tt1147621,Playing Columbine,Playing Columbine,0,2008.0,94,Documentary,7.1,173.0,Danny Ledonne,"Made on a shoestring budget with entry-level middleware, Super Columbine Massacre RPG! has easily provoked more debate and discussion than one could imagine a 16-bit role-playing game ever would. In the documentary film Playing Columbine: a true story of videogame controversy, the history of the game is traced back to its inception, through the 2006 shooting at Dawson College in which the game was singled out by the media as a murder simulator that trained the shooter, and finally the game's removal from the list of finalists at the Slamdance 2007 Guerrilla Gamemaker Competition - prompting half the entries and a sponsor to pull out of the festival in protest. Clearly the game has polarized audiences worldwide, giving way to ardent defenders as well as staunch critics. Beyond the controversial game itself, the film explores how controversial media is covered in the press, the school shooting phenomenon, and the future of games as an expressive medium."

Her family's resistance to the matter convinces Lucy that a secret lurks behind this mysterious double, and she sets out to find the woman. She slowly finds out that her doppelganger, Genevieve, was an infamous feminist and abortion activist and could be her real grandmother. Why did Genevieve disappear? Why was she scratched from her family's history? Why did she abandon Lucy's mother? Lucy's family stays mum. Her problems pile up when she discovers she's pregnant by her ex-boyfriend. Torn between her mother's advice of an immediate abortion and her ex-boyfriend's proposal, Lucy cannot choose. She finds refuge in the idea that finding Genevieve, who abandoned her own child and was fighting for abortion rights, holds the key to her past, therefore her future as a woman. As her family implodes, Lucy and her abrasive teen sister discover a family plot that leads her to revisit the history of women's liberation in Switzerland through archival footage and encounters with participants in the 1970s movement. Her final confrontation with Genevieve lets out the heavy secret that encumbered her family for three generations of women and forces Lucy to position herself as a feminist.

But learning to navigate and survive in a polar environment wasn't the only obstacle. This team skied the same icy terrain as the rarified community of predominantly white male polar explorers and scientists. At many points in the journey, their place at the table was in question. Representing the nations of Slovenia, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Sweden, Saudi Arabia, France, and the U.K., the team worked through profound differences in language, religion, communication and culture to achieve a singular, common goal. In the end, four team members, including Sheikha Asma Al Thani of Qatar, became the first ever from their nations to ski to the North Pole.Our first stop was the Arctic outpost of Longyearbyen on Norway's Svalbard Archipelago, the northernmost community in the world. There we waited for a Russian team to build Ice Station Barneo - an epic undertaking delayed nearly three weeks in the wake of two recent helicopter crashes that grounded all aviation. When go-time finally came, we flew to Barneo to fuel up, and then in a MI-8 helicopter that dropped us and our sledges, laden with hundreds of pounds of gear, at 2 AM, into -39°F temperatures at roughly 89 degrees North. About 100 KM from the North Pole. And then, we skied."

tt1950274,Mulberry Child,Mulberry Child,0,2011.0,85,"Biography,Documentary,Drama",7.9,52.0,Susan Morgan Cooper,"Jian Ping was born in China in 1960 during widespread famine caused by the economic disaster of Mao Zedongs Great Leap Forward. Tens of millions starved to death in the years preceding the charismatic leaders brutal and repressive Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and his call to crush the Four Olds. Chaos became rampant as Mao empowered youth to revolution, threatening, humiliating, beating and killing anyone they chose to persecute.Jian was tiny, premature, often sick and unwanted by an already overburdened mother of four. She was left in the care of her grandmother, Nainai, without whom she might surely have died. It wasnt that love was lacking. It was simply unstated, expressions of emotion considered bourgeois, essentially forbidden under Communist rule.
Her parents were devoted to the Party, her mother placing duty to Mao above her own children. Her father, equally staunch in his belief, survived torture at the hands of Japanese invaders when he was young. Suspected of giving secrets to the enemy in exchange for his life while in captivity, he was later exonerated. He gradually distinguished himself, eventually becoming Deputy Governor of the city province of Baicheng.As danger escalated under Mao, neighbors indicted neighbors. Family members informed on one another. No one was safe. Without warning, Jians father was arrested and imprisoned, old suspicions causing him to be publicly humiliated and labeled Big Traitor. Jians mother, a school administrator, was detained and forced to write daily self-recrimination. Strong- willed, she refused to submit to harassment by the Red Guards insisting she denounce and divorce her husband. She would not allow her children to be fatherless.Forced to leave the Government compound, Jians older siblings were sent to the countryside for re-education by peasants. Jian and Nainai were banished to a remote and primitive mud hut to endure harsh conditions and sub-zero temperatures. It was years before the Cultural Revolution came to an end and Mao Zedong died in 1976. For Jian, vivid memories remain of a little girl of eight dodging a barrage of epithets and rocks as she made her way to see her father in prison. She has long held the belief that she must always remain composed, neither showing vulnerability to those who might seek to harm her nor pain to those she loves.As China moved forward, Jian resumed her education. earning an undergraduate degree in English, then immigrating to the United States to attain two masters degrees. She married and bore a baby girl who joined her mother in the States when she was five. As Jian worked hard to provide the trappings of a middle class American life for her daughter Lisa, ironically, a sense of disconnection seeming to build between them. Her eight-year odyssey to write her memoir, Mulberry Child, was born of a need to reveal her past under Mao and share Chinese family roots with Lisa. She was saddened when Lisa showed no interest in the book.When Jian Ping and Lisa returned to China for a bittersweet family visit and the triumphant 2008 Beijing Olympics, Lisa agreed to read the manuscript. Tracing her familys history, she began to see her mother in a different light and accept her own heritage."

Over the years, Pat has learnt how whales see and hear, how they perceive other creatures in the water and how they behave at close quarters. He has a finely tuned sense and knows how to act when within touching distance of a whale - what to do, what not to do and when. This allows him to consistently get closer than anyone else alive - a truly unique skill. Patrick recently experienced a life-changing event. In Dominica in 2019, he had a close encounter with a female sperm whale. She seemed to be curious about him, coming within touching distance, pulsing him with her sonar. She studied him as he studied her. Patrick felt an overwhelming sense that she was genuinely trying to communicate. We will follow Patrick as he travels to Dominica again to find this special whale he named Dolores so she can help him show us the hidden world of her species. Using stunning underwater footage, Patrick will explore the fascinating nature of the sperm whale, attempting to shine a light on its intelligence and complexity, as well as highlighting its current and past relationship with humankind. The film will also follow his personal journey and explore the psychology of a man who has sacrificed everything in his single-minded quest to connect with and understand the biggest creatures in the ocean."

One has dedicated his life to unmasking lies and the other has built his life on lies. Making use of both their personal and political histories, Grimonprez gradually reveals the depths of trauma and duplicity, situating the arms trade as a symptom of a profound illness: greed.

Nissim and his brother George, together with Aharon Gabardine, who was the projectionist back in the old days, are determined to fulfill Morris' request. The same day Nissim has his dream, Avram Mandabon, Morris' brother, returns for his brother's memorial after a 25-year absence. His reappearance causes old family feuds to resurface.

Following the advice of Yisrael the Indian, considered the neighborhood authority on films, the brothers decide to screen the Indian-made local hit from years before, Sangam, to which Seniora objects (Nobody cares to watch old Indian movies!) and tries to convince them to screen another movie, but they insist. They eventually find out that the only print of Sangam is in the hands of Avram, their uncle, who refuses to give it to them. And so, as the time for Morris' memorial approaches, as well as the screening date, it seems that a clash is inevitable.

One of the male adults helps the other family members to hide, but with nowhere else in the house to hide he jumps out a window and flees, only to be ridden down by a horsemen, captured and kidnapped to a foreign kingdom. He is dragged before a royal court of monsters (literally and figuratively) consisting of the monstrously fat king and his equally repulsive court, called Hop-Frog because of his now-limping gait, and forced to become the new jester.One morning, the practical joke-obsessed king orders the inventive yet sensitive Hop-Frog to provide entertainment for the arriving Duke and Duchess of Siri-Siril. Following Hop-frog's physical comedy and a sumptuous banquet, the king's guests wheel in a giant bird cage, containing a young dwarfish woman named Tripetta, as a gift for the king. It's love at first sight for Hop-Frog, but his feelings and the condescending and cruel treatment at the hands of the so-called normal courtiers only tortures him even more. Events take an even uglier turn when the king summons Hop-Frog, orders him to come up with a original idea for an upcoming costume ball and forces him to drink goblets of wine (which the poor dwarf can't handle). Trippetta, who has been forced to be present, tries to halt the bullying, but has a goblet of wine thrown in her face for her efforts. This in turn has the effect of immediately sobering Hop-Frog up, and he comes up with a brilliant idea: the king and his councillors will be covered in fur and pretend to be ourangutangs bound together by a lengthy chain and, most appealing to the King's sadistic nature, scare the you-know-what out of everybody. The conceit is a strange one, but the King and his men readily accept it. Later that night, Hop-frog frees Trippetta from her cage to assist him in carrying out his plans for the costume ball.The night of the ball arrives and the plan is carried out; the king and his councillors are sewn into tight-fitting body-suits (which are painted all over with tar and covered with flax) and equipped with carved wooden masks. The illusion is a flawless one, so much so that when the Eight Chained Ourangutangs bust into the party at midnight and create their commotion, none of the guests complain when Hop-Frog lowers a chandelier chain down from the ceiling, hooks it to the chain connecting the beasts and has it and the apes hoisted into the air. Using a torch to pretend to try and find out who these costumed people are, he sets them all afire, with the other partygoers too far out of reach to help. He and Trippetta (who has been waiting on the roof) watch coldly from the roof as the fire claims its victims, then escape into the air on a makeshift flying machine as flames slowly spread through the kingdom."

Their goal: to win the contest and become professional surfers. Thirteen-year-old Fabio and 12-year-old Naama live at Favela do Pavao, an enormous slum near Arpoador Beach, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Pavao is home to Commando Vermelho (CV), or Red Command, one of Rio's most heavily armed drug gangs. It's the Red Command who sets the rules and regulates life in the community. Their presence is ubiquitous, with armed soldiers constantly patrolling the hills and regulating the various points of sale. Fabio lives in an area of the favela called Vietnam, the poorest and most violent part of the slum. When the police come up looking for traffickers, that's where they look - and shoot - first. Raised by illiterate grandparents, he cannot read or write and is not going to school. Fabio is a prime candidate to join CV and become yet another gun-toting teenager involved in Rio's drugs war. In fact, he already shows worrying signs: mouthing off to the police, bullying some of the younger surfers and threatening Naama. Naama lives around the corner from Fabio. Born under a bridge where he lived until he was three, he and his family moved to the favela 9 years ago. What will happen to these best friends? Will any of them win the contest? Will their own relationship survive Fabio's aggressive personality? Can surfing offer a way out for Fabio or will he follow in the footsteps of his dad and join the drug gang?

It wasn't until 1980's were people allowed to go home to visit in Mainland China).

Given three months to create a show about abusive relationships, the kids, aged 15-24, start by boldly exploring their own love lives.

Nearly everyone has had some sort of an abusive relationship, and now the guys who abused and the girls who have been abused are forced to reckon with each other, sometimes very loudly. The process is both exhilarating and painful but the members of FACES grow in their understanding of abuse and, in the end, their new show is triumphant.

A radioactive matter. 33 years after the disaster.5 days and nights illegally in the restricted area, in Pripyat and on the Duga-1 antenna.The restricted area from a completely different point of view. No cellphone connection, no help from outside, all on your own.
Together with STALKER we move illegally into the zone of alienation, also called the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.
Partly the children of former liquidators of the nuclear accident.
At the first night we are stuck between different rivers and the marshes at some point and have to turn around. But then there is a way.
We walk at night, stay in abandoned villages until we reach Pripyat.
A formerly over 40000 inhabitants large city lies before us, uninhabited.
A beauty spreads before us. But this beauty hurts too.And you do not feel alone all the time. Are these just the ghosts of yesteryear or is there more?We also climb onto the largest still existing, former listening antenna. Called Woodpecker and can we sleep up there at 140 meters above the ground?
5 days after which the feet ache, the shoulders do not want to carry the backpack anymore. But the impressions are stronger than any pain.5 days and nights that are not only physically hard, but also changed something in our soul and heart.
A journey that becomes more than just the illegal entry into the death zone!"
