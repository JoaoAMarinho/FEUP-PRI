tt0478970,Ant-Man,Ant-Man,0,2015.0,117,"Action,Adventure,Comedy",7.3,659739.0,Peyton Reed,"In 1989, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) resigns from SHIELD after realizing that Howard Stark (John Slattery) had been trying to replicate his shrinking technology.In the present day, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has just served his last day at San Quentin State Prison. Waiting to pick him up is his old cellmate, Luis (Michael Peña), who offers to let him stay at his apartment. Scott is unable to find a legitimate job with his criminal record. He had found out that the company he worked for had been overcharging their customers, so he hacked into the system and transferred millions of dollars back to the customers. Luis introduces him to Dave (T.I.), a getaway driver, and Kurt (David Dastmalchian), an identity theft specialist. Luis has a tip about a robbery they could do together.Hank gets invited to a presentation at the company he founded, Pym Tech. He runs into his daughter, Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), and his former protege, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), who shows him a prototype of the Yellow Jacket suit, modeled after the Ant-Man suit that Hank wore. Darren has not had success at shrinking living tissue.Scott borrows Luis' van and drops in on the birthday party of his daughter, Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson). He runs into Cassie's soon-to-be stepfather, Officer Jim Paxton (Bobby Cannavale) , who is not happy to see him. His ex-wife, Maggie (Judy Greer) tells him that he has to find a legitimate job and pay off his delinquent child support before she'll allow visitation with Cassie. Jim and his partner, Gale (Wood Harris) insist that Scott leave the party after saying goodbye to Cassie.At Pym Tech, Hope and Darren are trying to shrink sheep to microscopic size. Their experiment fails, and a sheep is killed. Darren insists they press forward with another sheep.Scott realizes that it will be more than a year before he can see Cassie again if he takes a minimum-wage job, so he takes up Luis on his offer. Luis' cousin, Ernesto (Nicholas Barrera) had a friend, Emily (Lyndsi LaRose), who was a housekeeper and was dating Ernesto's friend, Carlos (Carlos Aviles). She told Carlos that the man whose house she was cleaning has a giant safe that's sure to be holding valuables. Scott agrees to help them with the robbery.Luis picks up supplies for the break-in, and Kurt steals a communication technician's uniform. That night, Kurt climbs up a pole outside Hank's house and blocks the electrical circuit, cutting off all phone communication. Scott climbs the fence and takes out the window sensors, then pries open a window and heads to the basement. He unlocks the basement door only to find a second door that is fingerprint-coded. Using tape, he lifts Hank's print and opens that door. When he gets to the safe, he realizes that he'll need some ingenuity to break the steel door. He drills small holes around the lock, then squirts in water and uses nitrogen to freeze it. The frozen water warps the steel and causes the bolts to shoot out. When he opens the safe, the only thing inside is a weird-looking body suit and helmet. He grabs that and heads out. Meanwhile, Hank has been watching the whole episode upstairs.Dejected at not having gotten anything valuable, the group heads back to Luis' apartment. Scott goes into the bathroom and examines the suit he stole, wondering why it was so heavily guarded. He notices tubes full of red and blue liquid. Out of curiosity, he puts it on and steps into the bathtub to get a better look at himself in the mirror. Noticing a red button on the glove, he pushes it and instantly shrinks, becoming a half-inch tall. Luis comes into the bathroom and he turns on the water in the tub, which is like a tidal wave for tiny Scott. He hears a voice coming from an earpiece in the helmet. He tries pushing a blue button to return to normal size, but it's broken. Panicked, he jumps away from the water and finds himself sailing across the room. He lands in a crack and falls through to the apartment below.In that room, there's a party going on, and Scott realizes he's on a record player, with the needle moving toward him. He jumps free and lands on the floor where people are dancing. Avoiding the giant footsteps, he gets under the door and into the hallway, where he is promptly sucked up into a vacuum cleaner. When the dust bag gets emptied, he jumps again, this time landing on a rat. He runs away, but lands on a mouse trap. When it's triggered, it sends him flying out through a window and into the rainy night. He sees raindrops as big as his head, before landing on a car. The impact jarred the blue button free, and he grows back to normal size.Scott races home and takes off the suit. Realizing that someone had been tracking him all along, he decides to return the suit to Hank's safe. He easily breaks into the house again and puts the suit back. But when he gets out, he's surrounded by cops. He is arrested and brought to prison, where Paxton is waiting for him. Gale tells Paxton that Scott's lawyer is there. Confused, Scott goes to see the lawyer that he hadn't asked for and doesn't know.The lawyer waiting for him is Hank. He offers Scott two choices: life in prison or follow his instructions. Scott is thoroughly bewildered, so Hank tells him that he allowed him to steal the suit. Scott is taken back to his cell, and an army of ants brings him back the suit. He puts it on and shrinks, and then quickly escapes from the prison. One of Hank's ants spreads its wings, and Scott climbs on and flies over the city.Hank tells Scott that he invented the suit, but was afraid it would be misused, and so he had locked it away. Darren had found out about the shrinking technology, but when Hank wouldn't give it to him, Darren forced Hank out of Pym Tech. When Hope realized how dangerous Darren was, she teamed up with Hank to stop him. Hank tells Scott that he needs him to become Ant-Man to stop people like Darren. Scott realizes he has a chance to become a true hero, the kind of father his daughter deserves.Scott gets trained in martial arts and how to lead the ant colonies. He practices his timing with shrinking and growing back. Hank tells him that one piece of technology he'll need to steal the suit from Darren is in an abandoned SHIELD building. When Scott flies to the building, he sees that it's the current Avengers' headquarters. Pressing forward, Scott lands on the roof, triggering a sensor. Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) arrives to investigate, and he can see Scott even at small size. A battle ensues, with Scott going inside Falcon's jetpack and causing it to short out. Scott escapes with the equipment he needs.When Scott returns, Hank explains the truth about how Hope's mother died. There was an ICBM that had been launched at the U.S., and Hank was trying to stop it, but even at ant-size, he couldn't get inside. She had a similar suit, called the Wasp. She decided to shrink to sub-atomic size and was able to stop the missile, but she couldn't return from that size and was lost in the quantum realm.Darren Cross finally has success at shrinking a lamb. He envisions himself taking over Pym Tech. He invites Hank to the grand unveiling, then calls Hope and tells her that he has increased security, including covering all the vents with microscopic mesh. They realize the job will be harder than they thought, and they'll need more people. Luis, Kurt and Dave are brought in. Luis poses as a security guard and lowers the water pressure so Scott can get in through the pipes.Scott plants explosives throughout the building, but when he tries to steal the suit, he gets caught in a glass cage by Darren, who had anticipated the burglary. Darren plans to sell the technology to HYDRA. Scott breaks free and takes out the Hydra agents. Darren gets into a chopper on the roof and escapes just before the building blows up. Hank and Hope break out by turning a tiny tank to full-size, and ride it out the side of the building.Darren puts on the Yellow Jacket suit, and he and Scott fight inside the helicopter. After they both fall out, Scott is able to trap Darren inside a bug zapper, but Jim Paxton shows up to arrest him before he can destroy the suit. Darren goes to Jim and Cassie's house and threatens their lives, hoping to draw Scott in. Scott arrives and they fight. The only way Scott can get inside Darren's suit is to shrink to sub-atomic size, and he causes Darren to shrink into nothing.Lang is trapped in the Quantum Realm, but hearing Cassie's voice, he manages to rewire the suit, reversing the process and returning him to normal size. Following the battle, a grateful Paxton covers for Scott so he would not have to go back to prison. Hank wonders if Hope's mother is also still alive somewhere. Luis tells Scott that the Falcon is looking for him.Mid-Credit Scene: After Lang's departure, Pym shows an upgraded prototype of the Wasp Suit to Hope, offering it to her. To which she replies, it's about damn time.Post-Credit Scene: Captain America and Falcon have the Winter Soldier in they're custody, and are trying to figure out what to do next. Unable to tell Iron Man due to the Accords, Wilson says he knows who to contact for help."

To make her unique and prize-wining documentary series, Oeke Hoogendijk filmed behind the closed doors of the museum for ten years. What meant to be a standard length documentary grew into a four-part epic about ambition, love of art and typically Dutch decision-taking processes, and finally 'part four' the historic and emotional 'homecoming' of the masterpieces in the spiny of 2013.

On the other side Franz's cousin Toni, is setting up a nightclub on the ground floor of the hotel with an entrepreneurial spirit in diametric opposition to it's surroundings. Guests are to be lured with a high-class lounge act along with a quiz show developed by Franz's own father, Alfons.

We start in the sky and for a moment, see the shadow of an umbrella in the clouds. The camera goes lower and lower as a weathervane turns to point east and a young girl, Ginty (the real name of P.L. Travers) is seen playing make believe in her front yard. The disembodied voice of Travers Goff says, Winds in the East, mist coming in, like something is brewing, about to begin. Can't put my finger on what lies in store but I feel what's to happen all happened before. This is the same overture that begins Mary Poppins.Now it's the year 1961. Pamela P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) is a beautiful, sophisticated and smart but also grumpy, stuffy and rather unkind woman living in London. Her home office reveals she has already found success as the author of the Mary Poppins series. The doorbell rings and she finds Diarmiud Russell, her agent. They talk in her living room. She tells him she's cancelled the car because she no longer needs a ride to the airport, having changed her mind about giving up the rights to her story. Diarmuid points out she has a verbal agreement and can be sued but she replies by saying she has no money for him to claim. He confirms this as he reminds her that sales have dried up and there are no more royalties -- and that she has just recently reached terms after 20 years of being pursued -- no animation, script approval. To keep her house, Pamela agrees to venture to Los Angeles to hear the studio out but promises to leave the papers unsigned if she's not happy with their interpretation.In a flashback, we see Travers Goff (Colin Farrell) surprise his daughter, a young Pamela, nicknamed Ginty. He says he's looking for his daughter, the royal princess, and Ginty laughs and reveals it's her. They are obviously close. He puts her on his shoulders and they rush into the park, with him telling her their adventure is about to begin.In current day, Pamela is trying to load a giant bag into the overhead locker. A flight attendant asks if she needs help but Pamela refuses, saying she's perfectly capable. She blames the nearby passengers for being greedy and taking up the space. The flight attendant suggests they put the bag up front but Pamela refuses since it should remain close to her assigned seat. A nearby woman offers to have her bag taken up front instead; instead of thanking her, Pamela notices her toddler and asks if baby is going to be a nuisance during the flight. She then settles into her seat and says, I hope we crash.In 1906, we meet Ginty's three-year-old sister, Biddy, and her delicate mother, Margaret. Ginty is playing with her father, as usual. They all hold suitcases and say goodbye to the staff that used to take care of their house; they now walk on foot throughout town to get to the train station. Travers turns it into a game but his wife is heartbroken. They finally take the train to its very last stop, Allora, a rundown city.In 1961, Pamela is on the plane and awakes with a jerk from her memory. When she arrives at LAX, she exits the plane and finds a driver holding a sign with her name and Walt Disney Presents. This is the first time we've heard it is Disney that wants her story and not the other major studios. Her driver, Ralph (Paul Giamatti) greets her enthusiastically, a huge contrast from her grumpy persona. As they drive in his town car, Ralph optimistically talks about the sunny day and how, outside, it smells like jasmine; Pamela thinks it's more like chlorine and sweat. He tries to make her comfortable but she finds him irritating and raises the screen to separate her from him. He is unfazed.Pamela arrives at the Beverly Hills Hotel. The porter offers to help her unpack but she tells him if wants to handle ladies' garments, he should get a job in a launderette. He leaves, without a tip, and Pamela then becomes horrified at all the gifts Walt Disney has had put in her room, to welcome her. Flowers, champagne, a fruit basket, Disney merchandise. But her biggest concern is the pears in the fruit basket, so she plucks them all out.Cut to a flashback of the Goff family (PLs real last name) settling into their Allora house. It is a rundown shack on barren land, obviously heartbreaking for Margaret (Ginty's mother). But Travers calls it a palace and boasts that they now have chickens and in this smaller house, Ginty will get to SHARE a bedroom.In the current day, Pamela walks to the balcony and throws the pears she had plucked from the fruit basket into the hotel pool. She then goes back in her room and gathers up all the Disney paraphernalia, shoving it all into a closet, and arranging a giant stuffed Mickey Mouse that's been left on the bed so that it faces out of the window. She tells it, You can stay there until you learn the art of subtlety. She is clearly nervous about Walt Disney being the one to adapt her stories into a movie.Pamela unpacks her bag and turns on the hotel television. There, she stumbles upon The Wonderful World of Disney Show with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) hosting. She quickly turns off the TV.The next morning, Ralph picks Pamela up at the hotel. He is friendly, gleeful about how sunny the day is again. She mocks him for getting excited that the sun has come out as if she was in somehow responsible, reminding him it's California. He replies, cheerfully, It certainly is! She gets in the car and says she'd rather be accountable for the rain. He tells her that's sad and she tells him, The rain brings life. He tells her, So does the sun but she tells him to be quiet.When they arrive at the Disney Studios in Burbank, they are greeted by Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford), the film's screenwriter, and the Sherman Brothers, who are writing the film's songs (B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman). Don is friendly but she is indifferent to him for not calling her Mrs. Travers. She then chastises him for telling the Sherman Brothers that she created Mary and not Mary Poppins. Finally, she reveals she is not planning on giving away the rights to the character because the film should not be upbeat nor a musical. They try to take her on the tour of the studio but she says doesn't care and only wants to see Walt.Pamela is now in Walt's office. She demands that his secretary tell him she's arrived. Don tells her she can call him Walt because he thinks Mr. Disney is unnecessary. Walt arrives, enthusiastically greeting her, but Pamela remains unfriendly, calling him Mr. Disney even when he insists she just call him Walt. In his private office, he reminds Pamela that he's been trying for 20 years to talk her into giving him the film rights. His daughters were reading the Mary Poppins book back then and he promised them he would turn it into a film. That's why he has been adamant in securing the rights so he can live up to this promise, as well as making kids happy who will finally get to see Mary speak and sing to them. Pamela uses this to bring up her disapproval of the film being turned into a musical, explaining a governess shouldn't be giddy. She writes off Disney as creating silly cartoons. He tries to reassure her that he won't tarnish the story she holds dear to her because he loves Mary Poppins, too. Pamela reminds him that she has not signed the agreement yet and that it stipulates the film will be live action and not animated -- she wants this made clear via a recorded statement by Walt. He remains calm, telling her they're going to make something wonderful. She responds by saying she has yet to see if that is even possible, and then exits the office, leaving Walt dumbfounded.In flashback, Travers is playing a whistle while Ginty listens from his lap. Margaret comes to the porch and suggests Ginty go to bed. Alone on the porch, Travers promises his wife a good life and to make her proud of him again. She is hopeful.In present day, Pamela is in a rehearsal room on the studio property. She prepares for the meeting, stone-faced, while Walt's secretary, Dolly, fills the room with snacks and beverages. This irritates Pamela who says the amount of food could save a starving country and complains that the flowers in the room could have easily been enjoyed from a window without having to be yanked out of the ground. She turns on the tape recorder to document all of her input since she has demanded creative control. They begin to read the script, with Don reading the scene heading of Exterior, 17 Cherry Tree Lane. Pamela interjects, asking what is EXT? She then demands it be spelled out and not abbreviated, and also that it should be NUMBER 17 Cherry Tree Lane instead of 17 Cherry Tree Lane. Dolly comes in with more snacks and Pamela gets irritated.As the read-through continues, Pamela voices her concern about casting Dick Van Dyke, suggesting they use Laurence Olivier or Richard Burton or Alec Guinness instead. The Sherman Brothers begin to sing the song they've written for the opening -- but Pamela stops them to point out responstable is not a word. When Richard excitedly tells her they made the world up, Pamela tells them to un-make it up. At the piano, Richard hides the next page of sheet music a song titled Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Pamela then suggests they work the old vaudeville song, Ta Ra Ra Boom De Ay, into the film instead of the original music the Sherman Brothers are suggesting.At home, Pamela reminiscences about her childhood, bringing us to a flashback of Travers telling Ginty her horse is actually Uncle Albert under the spell of a witch. He lifts her up and tells her to pretend to fly.The next session in the rehearsal room, Pamela is shown storyboard illustrations and finds fault with them all. She tells the team that the illustration of the Banks's house doesn't look as she imagines it and that Mrs. Banks shouldn't be a suffragette and shouldn't be named Cynthia. When she sees a picture of Mr. Banks, she says that it's not him because hes not supposed to have a mustache. She explains, the only reason he has facial hair in the books is because the illustrator ignored her wishes but now that it is HER film, she will have her way. Dolly points out the mustache was a specific request from Walt. Pamela replies that Mr. Banks is clean shaved. Finally, Robert erupts, saying Does it matter?! Pamela stares at him and then orders him to wait outside.She goes back to the hotel, the merry sounds of people bringing her to a flashback of her with her father. He shaves his face clean and asks if she prefers a rough face when he gives her kisses or one that;s silky smooth. It's obvious that Mr. Banks is based on him, thus why she was insisting that Mr. Banks look as she envisioned him.The next time she's at the Disney Studios, she gets frantic after Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious is introduced. Dolly goes to Walt's office to give him an update -- Pamela wants Mrs. Banks's name changed to Winifred, she doesn't want Dick Van Dyke, she doesn't like the house, she doesn't want Mr. Banks to have a mustache, the tape measure used to record the children's height should be a roll tape and not a ruler, she only wants green vegetables and broth for snacks (in the rehearsal room), and that she doesn't want the color red in the film -- at all.Walt now joins Pamela and the others in the rehearsal room. She reminds him that she has final say and insists, again, that there should be no red in the movie. He points out that the film is set in London where there's a lot of red but she says she wants it banished simply because she feels anti-red at the moment. He asks if she's testing him but she replies she took him at his word when he said that she would get final say on everything. She offers to return the agreement back to him, unsigned, so he agrees that there will be no red in the film.Walt leaves and the others now realize that Walt has not been granted the rights yet. Pamela asks them to sing another song. They sing The Perfect Nanny and Pamela shouts criticisms throughout. As they continue on, she shouts into the tape recorder, Nobody's listening to me! as if her documented complaints will then hold merit. When the song finishes, Pamela says it's the worst song she's ever heard.Later that afternoon, Walt is looking out his window. He sees Pamela sitting on a bench, getting into the limo after Ralph arrives. Back at the hotel, Pamela has another memory -- as a young girl, she enters the bank in Allora where her father works since it is their special Ice Cream Day; but Travers is intoxicated and is fired by his employer, all in front of Ginty. The boss finally agrees to hire him back upon seeing Travers's daughter but tells him that he needs to straighten himself out, for his daughters sake. Moments later, Travers and Ginty are by the river; she eats ice cream while he drinks from a hip flask and gives a drunken speech.Pamela calls her agent from her hotel room, complaining about the adaptation of her story and how she is having flashbacks of her childhood. But she has to admit that she needs the money. After hanging up the phone, she pulls the giant Mickey Mouse from the window and cuddles with it for comfort.The next morning, the rehearsal room has healthier options for food (per Pamela's request). The Sherman Brothers brainstorm ideas until they come up with a spoonful of sugar.Outside, Walt meets Pamela at the limo and escorts her upstairs. The brothers play the newly written Spoonful of Sugar, deciding that the word down should be played higher, along the lines of Mary Poppins doing the unexpected, like going UP the bannisters. They are in love with this new song and predict it will be iconic. Pamela is unimpressed and calls it an annoying tune akin to something that would play at Walt's themed park, all giddy and carefree. She points out to Walt that Mary Poppins is the enemy of sentiment and whimsy; that she is truthful and doesn't sugar coat the darkness to the children. She complains that the script is flim flam and not rooted in reality. After declaring it has no weight, she opens a window and flings the pages out -- proving that the script literally has no weight. Walt responds by saying Says the woman who sends a flying nanny with a talking umbrella to save the children. Pamela responds, You think Mary Poppins is saving the children? She sighs and shakes her head.Late that afternoon, Pamela is on the same bench. She thinks back to playing with the laundry hanging outside when her dad comes home early. They chase a hen who Travers says is their foul Aunt Ellie in disguise. During the game, Pamela's mum notices a whisky bottle protruding from Travers's pocket. That night, Ginty stays awake at night, while her parents argue; her mother is suggesting Ellie come over to help the family raise the girls.In the rehearsal studio the next day, Richard previews Feed the Birds, which touches Walt. They both fear Pamela will hate it, nonetheless.In another flashback, we see Ginty and her father playing pretend, which irritates Margaret. Travers tells Ginty, Don't ever stop dreaming. You can be anyone you want to be. She says she wants to be like him but he tells her Don't. He begins crying.Ralph drives Pamela but she is distracted. Her memories continue. Ginty gives a speech at her school fair. Her father is going to be presenting the medals on behalf of the bank.In the rehearsal room, Pamela is still distracted. They get her attention and perform Fidelity Fiduciary Bank for her. This is juxtaposed with another fantasy, of her father showing up to the fair drunk. When he presents the medals, he tries to promote the bank he works at but he meanders, obviously drunk. As the bank song continues in present day, it is repeated as dialogue in the flashback. Finally, when Travers is supposed to present the medals, he slurs his speech. He tells everyone that his daughter has opened a bank account and the crowd should give her a drink, but then corrects himself, stressing give her a hand. He calls her up on stage but she is embarrassed and crushed, as her father was her hero. Somehow, he loses his footing and falls off of the stage. The crowd gasps, judgmentally.In present day, the Brothers applaud their new song along with Walt. Pamela can only say, Why did you have to make him so cruel? He was not a monster! She asks if they have children and they say, yes; she then points out all the mean things that Mr. Banks is written as doing, such as tearing up the advertisement the children have written, refusing to mend their kite. It's now obvious to us that she's protective of Mr. Banks's image and has issues with the story because all the characters are based on her family. She tells them she can't bear to let him down again and leaves the room, upset.In a flashback, Travers is in bed with a broken foot from the fall. He asks the doctor for painkillers but the doctor realizes that he just wants the high. After he leaves, Travers asks Ginty to get him a bottle of medicine that her mother has hidden but she refuses, knowing of her mum's decision. She tries to share a poem she wrote for him at school that won first prize; he reads it and tells her It's hardly Yeats, is it? Ginny is devastated. We now realize that this is the turning point in Pamela's life.Pamela rushes through the Disney lot and finds a quiet spot on the lawn in the back of a sound stage. She has more flashbacks; Ginty finding the bottle of medicine and leaving it with her sleeping father. Pamela is daydreaming, playing with a daisy, when Ralph catches her. He has brought her tea but Pamela tells him it is blasphemy to drink tea from a paper cup. Nonetheless, she lets him have a conversation with her, despite being obviously upset. She tells him she wants to go back to England and points out she doesn't really have any close family members. He tells her his daughter is handicapped and it's made him appreciate sunny days where she can sit outside in the garden and not be cooped up inside, like on rainy days (a callback to his cheerfulness about the weather when they first met). Now warming to him, Pamela shows off a park she has built in the grass, with twigs. She pours her tea to make a stream.In flashback, Margaret enters Ginty's bedroom at night and tells her she knows she gave her father the bottle of pills. She tells Ginty that she is aware she loves her father more than her, but one day, she'll understand. Margaret then leaves the house, despite Ginty's screams for her to come back. Ginty then has to comfort her younger sister by telling her a story about little girls alone in a house who shouldn't be afraid because a guide will show up from the stars and show them magic.Ginty goes out looking for her mother. She finds her in the freezing water of the creek. She convinces her mum to go home.In current day, Pamela gets a phone call from Walt. He wants to know why she has been so upset lately. She doesn't have a response. He suggests the two of them go to Disneyland. She is less than enthusiastic at the suggestion, calling it a dollar printing machine, but he doesn't take no for an answer, hanging up on her.In a flashback, Aunt Ellie arrives at the Goff household with a parrot-headed umbrella and giant carpetbag. She is obviously the inspiration for Mary Poppins. She tells Ginty's sister to close her mouth because she is not a codfish (a line from the film). She puts the girls to work and is very strict with them.Ralph drives Pamela to Disneyland and they park on the property. Walt Disney greets them, exciting Ralph who has never met him in person; Pamela is not impressed though. The two walk through the park where young fans ask for Walt's autograph. Walt gives out pre-signed pictures, his method of dealing with attention when he goes to the park. Walt encourages the crowd to get Pamela's signature too and even though they happily offer her something to sign, she mockingly rejects them (possibly implying a case of inferiority complex).As they walk down Disneyland's Main Street, Walt asks Pamela where she came from. Pamela knows he is talking about Mary Poppins and says she flew in through the window one day. He is not impressed with her standoffish attitude and says, because she clearly doesn't want to be there, they'll go on one ride and then go. The two are now on King Arthur's Carousel. Pamela hesitates to get on the ride, even after Walt tries to coerce her, by pointing out that there's a child in all of us. She only gives in after Walt adamantly demands Get on the horse, Pamela. He then tells her the Sherman Brothers have an idea for Mr. Banks that will be to her liking. She asks if he brought her all the way to Disneyland just to tell her that; he responds, no, he had made a bet that he couldn't get her on one ride and now he just earned 20 bucks.In flashback, Aunt Ellie takes care of Travers, who is coughing up blood. Outside, Ginty cries at the decline of her fathers health.In the rehearsal room, there are no more snacks and all the tables have been pushed to the side. Don is eager to show Pamela the new scene they have written for Mr. Banks. It ends up being Lets Go Fly a Kite. Having come to peace with her past, Pamela can't help but hum along and then sing along and then dances. Dolly is ecstatic and runs to Walt's office where she tells him, I'm sorry to interrupt but Mrs. Travers - she's dancing with Don!Back in the rehearsal room, the song ends and Pamela admits she loves the song. But, in character, she points out that the proper English should be Let US go AND fly a kite. She is willing to overlook this, though.In a flashback, Ginty sits with her father in his bedroom. She says she has rewritten the poem he didn't like but he doesn't reply. She shows him the tuppence that Aunt Ellie has given her and asks if he wants anything. He asks for pears. Ginty steps out to get some pears. In present day, Pamela awakes in her hotel room from her dream, a memory of the day her father died.Now, riding in the limo, Pamela is upbeat, matching Ralph's optimistic perspective on life. In the rehearsal room, Pamela is much more pleasant. She okays the Jolly Holiday song but when she asks how they plan to train penguins, Richard tells her, They're animated. Upon hearing there will be cartoons in the film, Pamela storms out. She runs to Walt's office, uninvited, and calls him a trickster, a fraudster, a sneak. Pamela tells him that the music of the Sherman Brothers has charmed her but she won't cross the line and allow animated, dancing penguins. She gives him back the unsigned rights papers and says good day. Walt chases after Pamela but she just tells him he isn't living up to his promises. Ralph arrives and is about to drive her away. She tells Walt Disney she's sorry to put him through so much trouble but she is not ready to give her (Mary Poppins) up. They drive away.Pamela is driven to LAX. Ralph tells her it was a pleasure driving her, which she doesn't believe. He says he didn't know who she was until he mentioned to his daughter that he was driving around a Mrs. Travers for Walt Disney and she made him go to her bedroom and take her Mary Poppins book. He says he can't stop reading it. Pamela says she'd be honored to sign it. He asks her to inscribe it to Jane, his daughter. She hands him a piece of stationery with a list of names Albert Einstein, Van Gogh, Roosevelt, Frida Kahlo and tells him to give it to his daughter and tell her that a lot of people with difficulties do extraordinary things with their lives. At the bottom of the list is Walt Disney's name; she points out that he had difficulty concentrating and had hyperactive behavior as a kid.In his office, Walt Disney looks down at the paperwork with Pamela's flight itinerary, confirming she has, in fact, gone back to London. He wonders why her name is listed as Helen Goff and his secretary points out that it's her real name and she's actually Australian, not British. He wonders where she got the name Travers.In a flashback, Ginty comes home with the pears and discovers Ellie holding a bloodstained sheet. She drops the bag of pears onto the floor. Ginty rushes past her mum and aunt and steps into her fathers bedroom. She watches him die. She apologizes for dropping the pears.In London, Pamela settles back into her home, the one she can no longer afford. Later that night, there's a knock on the door and Walt Disney is there. He requests she make him a pot of tea. They talk and Walt tells her she misjudges him that she thinks of him as a Hollywood King Midas with an empire and that Mary Poppins will be just another brick in. He tells her, if this was the case, he wouldn't have pursued her for 20 years. He tells her Mary Poppins is real to his daughters, to thousands of children, and even adults. Walt apologizes to Pamela for letting her down and points out that he, too, had a Mr. Banks but his had a mustache; it was his own father, who had a newspaper delivery route and employed a young Walt and his brother to work during the cold winters. If he didn't live up to his father's standards, he would get beaten. He says he loves his father but he has days where he looks back and is tired of thinking of him in a negative light. He has to learn to finish the story differently, to let it all go and have a life that isn't dictated by the past. He realizes now, as she hinted, that it's not the children Mary Poppins comes to save but her father, Travers Goff. She must have loved him a lot to take his name. He now realizes all of her books were about him and encourages her to forgive him. She says she doesn't have to forgive her father, he was a wonderful man, but he says, no, she needs to forgive Helen Goff for giving herself a harsh sentence. He begins a monologue, telling her to trust her precious Mary Poppins with him and the audience will see Mr. Banks being saved and he can instill hope into the viewers.Pamela looks at the giant Mickey Mouse that she has brought home with her. She agrees to sign the papers.Years later, Mary Poppins is having its world premiere in Los Angeles. Pamela is not invited because Walt is afraid she will be a very difficult person and talk negatively with any journalist who asks her for an interview.In London, Pamela is writing a new Mary Poppins book and now has enough money to have a maid. Downstairs, her agent asks her if she's going to the film's premiere and she says she's not interested. He can tell that she wasn't invited and points out that Mary Poppins wouldn't stand for it.Pamela takes a plane again. The same flight attendant from before asks if she needs help with her bags and then recognizes Pamela from before. She lets her take care of herself.Walt returns to his office to find that Pamela is there, waiting. She points out she didn't receive an invitation and it must have gotten lost in the mail. Walt promises to issue a replacement.At her hotel, she asks the doorman to call for a taxi but just then, a limo pulls up. It is Ralph who is going to take her to the premiere.Pamela gets to the Grauman's Chinese Theater where various Disney characters mingle alongside celebrities, including the cast of Mary Poppins. Before she exits the limo, Ralph whispers to her, This is your night. None of this would be possible without you. He helps her to the carpet but she walks unnoticed, except for a giant Mickey Mouse who interacts with her.Inside, Pamela watches the film. She looks around at everyone in the audience laughing, singing along, having a good time. The scenes in the film remind her of her history, that we are now familiar with via the flashbacks.By the end of the movie, Pamela has tears streaming down her face. Walt Disney is sitting behind her. He leans forward and whispers It's all right, Mrs. Travers. Mr. Banks is going to be all right. She nods but responds, No, no. It's just that I can't abide cartoons!The final song plays, Lets Go Fly a Kite. Pamela can't help but sing along. She has one final flash back of Ginty at her father's bedside as he promises her I will never leave you. Cut back to the opening scene of the film with Ginty sitting in the grass embracing her father. The prologue from Mary Poppins again being spoken by Travers, the same weathervane turning to the west and the shadow of an umbrella. But this time, we rise higher and higher into the sky indicating that Marry Poppins work with Pamela is done and both can finally move on.During the first part of the credits there are pictures of the real Pamela Travers, Walt Disney, Sherman brothers, Don DaGradi, one of the men who inspired Ralph and concept art of the Mary Poppins film. During the second part there is seen a tape recorder next to a bowl of jellybeans (no doubt to recreate the moment) while recorded dialogue between the real Pamela, Sherman brothers and Don is heard as they discuss the script. As the tape runs out the screen turns to black."

As Charlie's father manages to calm her mother down, he engages in awkward and forced conversation about breakfast and school with Charlie, in an attempt to pretend everything is as usual. Charlie declines an offer from her father on getting a lift to school and we then see him driving away while Charlie watches before leaving on foot.Charlie arrives at school and seems to have a more normal relationship with her friends, as she happily greets them before her lessons. She also makes thoughtful contributions in a debate about passion and freedom, which her teacher commends her for. In the next scene, we see Charlie enjoying herself with her friends as she has lunch with them and is amused during a match of table football. Charlie walks home with her best friend, Victoire (Roxane Duran) as they have simple discussions about boys and school. When Charlie gets home, her mother is sat in the dark, smoking and looking solemn. Did he leave? asks Charlie. Yeah. I think so, her mother replies looking calm. However, later Charlie lays in bed unable to sleep from the sound of her mother crying.The next day, Charlie is sat in an amusing math class, laughing with the rest of the class as a boy at the front tries to solve an equation. As it goes on, there's a knock at the door and a member of staff enters with a new girl, Sarah Perrin (Lou de Laâge). Sarah seems excited and friendly and even helps the boy at the front with the equation before being seated next to Charlie. They exchange a friendly glance. Later, during gymnastics, Charlie curiously watches Sarah as she moves. While outside with her friends, Charlie is approached by Sarah who asks her if she could help her with the history homework. They agree to do it at Charlie's house. Sarah offers Charlie's friends some cigarettes and she explains they are from Nigeria as she lived there for 4 years while her mum worked for an NGO. After some rebels crossed the border and created a mess, she moved back to France to graduate. She adds that her mother still lives in Nigeria and she lives with her aunt.Sarah walks home with Charlie and Victoire. She tells an interesting story about an experience back in London which the girls enjoy, presumably because their own conversations aren't usually exciting. When Victoire leaves, Charlie explains to Sarah that she has known her since 6th grade. The scene cuts to Charlie's house where Charlie, her mother and Sarah are having enjoying Sarah's company as she talks about her annoying aunt. The phone interrupts their amusement and the mood instantly changes: Charlie knows it is her father calling. When her mother leaves to take the call, Charlie mentions her mother had her when she was 18. When Sarah asks about Charlie's father, Charlie says she should just tell him to fuck off. Sarah immediately gets up and grabs the phone downstairs the listen to their conversation and says Leave her alone. Fuck off. Her mother runs down in a frenzy, stunned that the girls would do something like that as she is worried he may actually leave for good. Charlie and Sarah begin laughing hysterically.Over the next few scenes, we see Charlie and Sarah spend more time together and begin to bond. They appear to unintentionally isolate themselves from the rest of the friendship group and grow closer. Sarah even does Charlie's make up one night and calls her beautiful before they head to a party and have a good time. Sarah looks after Charlie by holding up her hair when she is drunk and vomiting in the toilet.One day, Charlie's dad comes over the house to visit. He goes outside and sees Charlie sunbathing. He offers her a cigarette and she makes a comment about how irresponsible he is. He doesn't seem to care and remarks that he knows she smokes anyway. She accepts the cigarette. He begins to tickle her and she laughs; it is clear she does love her father despite his destructive behaviour. Charlie's mother watches from the window, smiling slightly at the sight of them bonding.Later that day, after Charlie's father has left, Charlie is sitting on the stairs listening to a conversation between her mother and Laura (Claire Keim), looking expressionless. Her mother explains that Charlie's father is growing more violent. Laura begins crying, exclaiming that if he touches her in anyway she will kill him. Charlie's mother says I'm afraid. Charlie enters the room as if she were not listening. Laura immediately changes the subject and begins talking about getting a dog. Charlie and her mother laugh weakly as if everything is normal. Laura invites Charlie to go with her to Vince and Marie's camp for All Saints Day. Charlie thinks it would be awesome but her mother protests that it would be awkward as she hasn't seen them in years. Laura persuades them to go anyway. Just then, the phone rings and it is Sarah. She explains to Charlie that her mother was supposed to come to France for All Saints Day but cancelled last minute. She comments that her mother couldn't care less and now she has to spend it with her annoying aunt. Charlie comforts her over the phone.The next scene shows Charlie, Charlie's mother, Laura and Sarah in an old car. It is suggested Charlie ended up inviting Sarah to the camp for All Saints Day. They are all hysterically laughing and genuinely seem happy. When they arrive, Sarah catches the eye of a handsome man with a wheelbarrow called Esteban (Alejandro Albarracín) who appears to do handy work for the camp. Later, while they are hanging out in the woods, Sarah comments about having sex with a British boy. She asks Charlie about her sexual experiences. Charlie says that she is a virgin but was close to losing her virginity with a boy called Lucas from school before she began crying from the pain and couldn't continue. She adds that she hasn't told anyone, not even her best friend Victoire. The chat ends light-heartedly with the girls laughing and running from the sound of an animal in the bushes.Later, while they are rolling up what looks like a cigarette, a local called Paul (Victor Assié) walks up to Charlie and Sarah and greets Charlie, asking if she remembers him. Charlie gets up to greet Paul back but accidentally drops her towel and flashes her naked body to him, causing Sarah to burst out laughing while Charlie appears mortified. Paul just calmly looks on. Charlie mentions that it has been ages since she last saw him. Charlie briefly introduces Sarah as her classmate before Paul confirms whether or not Charlie is going for drinks later. She agrees and he leaves. Sarah appears hurt and when Charlie asks why, she says that she would have introduced her as a friend, not a classmate. Charlie stays silent and Sarah tries to brush it off, appearing more quick-tempered and bitter towards Charlie as they continue making the cigarettes.The scene cuts to Charlie attempting to zip the back of her dress, visibly struggling. Sarah gets up and does it for her and hugs her. It appears she has gotten over the earlier incident. We see Sarah, Charlie, Charlie's mother enjoying drinks with a group of people at a table. Sarah seems to be flirting with Esteban, the man from earlier with the wheelbarrow. That evening, in the caravan, Sarah and Charlie improvise a fictional scene between Sarah and Esteban. Sarah pretends Charlie is Esteban and kisses Charlie. She then slaps Charlie as part of the act and laughs. Charlie looks stunned.The next morning we see Charlie's mother leave Esteban's caravan, giggling. It is clear they spent the night together. Charlie hears her mother giggling and leaving the caravan. At the breakfast table, there are jokes made about Charlie's mother and Esteban spending the night together, Sarah looks hurt. Charlie joins the table and looks nervously at Sarah to see if she knows. Sarah tries to look unaffected and leaves the table. The scene changes to Sarah flirting with Paul. Charlie approaches them and they seem blunt. Paul explains he's offered to take Sarah out in his plane. The two leave holding hands as Charlie looks on. It is clear that Sarah has turned to Paul as a way of forgetting about Esteban. Charlie spends time alone at the foot of the sea and sees the plane in the sky.Later that evening, Charlie is unacquainted at a small gathering and begins playing an instrument with a stranger. Sarah approaches and kisses Charlie's hand. Charlie looks unaffected and continues playing the instrument when Sarah leaves. Sarah dances passionately to the music. The next morning, Charlie wakes up and sits at the door of her caravan, taking in the scenery. She suffers an asthma attack and uses her inhaler to restore her breathing. Charlie goes to Laura's caravan. She asks if she's seen Sarah. Laura tells her that she went to the market with Charlie's mother. Charlie looks defeated. Laura picks up on this and says Don't let it bug you. Sarah's not so amazing, before quickly changing the subject. Charlie's mother returns to find Charlie alone outside. She says you're not jealous are you? Charlie shakes her head. However her mum continues to talk about Esteban's good qualities. Her mother seems to really like Esteban. Later that evening, Sarah goes for another round of drinks with the locals. Charlie stays in the caravan in her bed looking solemn. Sarah enters the caravan and asks when she will stop sulking. Sarah jokes about Charlie's mother and Esteban and makes Charlie laugh. Charlie comments that it won't last. Sarah asks if she wants to sleep. Charlie says yes. Sarah leaves her and shuts the door with force. Charlie looks stunned. On car journey back home, Sarah leans on Charlie to nap. Charlie looks confused by the dynamics of their friendship.Back in Charlie's bedroom, Victoire is commenting on the fact that something is different. She notices that Charlie took her old posters down. It is clear that Victoire is seeing that Charlie has changed. The next scene shows Sarah greeting Charlie in a friendly way while Charlie still looks unsure of what to make of Sarah. Sarah appears closer to Charlie's friends now, too. Back at Charlie's house, Sarah and Charlie have a dull conversation. They are cold around each other. Sarah leaves and begins talking to Charlie's mother who still appears to like Sarah a lot. Later, Sarah and Charlie are brushing their teeth together. They begin laughing hysterically for no reason. It feels like old times.The next day at school, Charlie and Sarah are having lunch with the rest of their friends. Sarah makes a comment about her mother and her going for a safari the previous year. Charlie remarks that she thought Sarah's mother couldn't spend time with her last year. Sarah is bitter towards Charlie and accuses her of assuming she knows Sarah's life story. Charlie says it is what Sarah told her. Sarah ridicules Charlie in an attempt to defend herself. Sarah then giggles with Charlie's friends at the back of a science class.That night, Sarah calls Charlie's house. Sarah confronts Charlie about embarrassing her in front of everyone at lunch and making her look like a liar. Sarah manipulates Charlie into making her feel sorry for her, explaining that she made a mistake about when her mother left her. Charlie apologises and feels bad for what she did.The next scene cuts to Sarah on a train, on her way home. We learn that Charlie is following Sarah. Sarah lives in a dingy neighbourhood in a small apartment. She gets inside and is greeted by a drunk woman (Carole Franck). The woman is uneasy and unstable and asks Sarah where she's been. Sarah is bitter and appears to resent the woman. When the woman begins banging on a door, Sarah says Mom stop. Sarah's mother falls on the floor laughing hysterically. All the while, Charlie is listening outside Sarah's window, looking shocked.Charlie and Sarah are at a nightclub. They are separate but they seem to be enjoying themselves. Charlie approaches Sarah and asks what's going on with their friendship. Sarah brushes her off coldly. Charlie asks if the reason Sarah is bitter is because of her mother. Charlie explains that she saw her and she doesn't hold anything against Sarah for lying. Sarah asks if Charlie followed her. Charlie doesn't answer the question. Instead she says she promises not to tell anyone. Sarah looks stunned and angry. She threatens to kill Charlie if she tells anyone. Charlie looks sick as Sarah barges her and leaves. Charlie walks home very drunk.The scene switches to Charlie in her school toilets. She hears the sounds of Sarah and a friend walk into the toilets and sighs. They are talking about Lucas and the fact he's obsessed with Charlie. Sarah tells the friend that Charlie never had sex with Lucas because she cried (something that Charlie told her earlier in confidence). Charlie leaves the cubicle and confronts Sarah. Sarah appears unaffected. Charlie threatens to babble about Sarah's mother. Sarah dares her. Charlie begins and Sarah turns on the hand dryer to stop Charlie from being heard. Sarah leaves with the friends. Charlie cries when they are gone.We see Charlie go into a state of depression as she ignores her mother and begins to do badly at school. She constantly has to scrape off comments off her table that Sarah and her friends have written such as Charlie the whore and Charlie gives sodomy free. She is continuously bullied by Sarah and her friends, however turns to studying as a coping mechanism. However, her anxiety causes her to suffer from asthma attacks. One day at lunch, Victoire tells Charlie that she is devastated by the way Sarah is treating Charlie. She wonders why Charlie stands it. Charlie begins to completely isolate herself from everyone and makes her old friends wonder why she is so distant. One night, Charlie does her hair and attempts to do her makeup the way Sarah did it for her the night she called her beautiful. She fails and angrily takes everything apart.On a different day, Charlie is running track with other classmates as part of physical education. Sarah barges past her with ease and begins running ahead. In a moment of fury, Charlie runs faster and speeds past Sarah and takes the lead. She continues to push herself to run even faster and begins struggling to breathe. However, she pushes on and her breathing becomes very heavy. She eventually faints and hits the ground struggling desperately for air while a crowd gathers around her. Her vision is blurred but she clearly sees Sarah smirking at her through the crowd.We see Charlie looking out of a window, daydreaming. Her father and mother are heard speaking in the background, getting along. Her father asks if Charlie is okay and her mother comments that she is just moody. Her dad gives her a glass of champagne. He asks her about celebrations for her 18th birthday. She seems uninterested. Later that night she hears her parents having loud sex in the other room. The next morning while Charlie is brushing her hair, her mother comes in and tells her that she has ended it with Charlie's father for good. Charlie's mother appears unhappy but accepting to this decision. When she leaves, Charlie violently continues to brush her hair.The scene cuts to Charlie opening the front door to find Sarah, looking sad and bruised. Charlie offers her ice and Sarah begins talking while they are in Charlie's room. She explains that her mother hit her for the first time which made her leave. She opens up about telling lies and stories to other people as a way of escaping her real life. She says that Charlie is the only person she could go to. She asks Charlie if she hates her. Charlie says no. The two share Charlie's bed that night and while Sarah is asleep, Charlie watches her and appears happy that she is back. The next morning, Charlie and Sarah are happily leaving the house and Charlie's mother watches through the window and sees Charlie smiling and laughing like she used to. Before entering the school, Sarah tells Charlie they cannot be friends in school because it will confuse people. She says that this is payback for Charlie following her home. Charlie looks stunned as Sarah approaches Charlie's old friends in a similar way to how Charlie approached them at the beginning of the film. Later in class, Charlie witnesses Sarah give a friend a souvenir from Nigeria. She angrily attacks Sarah and begins fighting her before the whole class breaks them up and Charlie leaves the class, very upset.We see Charlie in an exam before taking a test. When she begins the test, she appears confident and immediately begins writing while some people complain about not even understanding the question. Sarah chases her in a corridor to remind her about leaving clothes at her place. Charlie completely ignores her. When she is outside, Lucas (Louka Meliava) approaches and asks her to come out with them. She declines and instead kisses him passionately. He says that he'll call her and is cheered on by his friends when he returns to the group. Back at home, Charlie's mother enters Charlie's room to find Charlie and Sarah. She tells Charlie she is going out with Laura, completely ignoring Sarah. She leaves. Once she leaves, Sarah comments that Charlie's mother hates her because of Charlie. She digs Charlie about how she turns everyone against her. She manipulates and emotionally torments Charlie about how she feels much better without Charlie and how much of a bad person Charlie is. Eventually, Charlie cannot take anymore and she pushes Sarah against her dresser, Sarah is slightly injured but begins laughing. This causes Charlie to grab a pillow and cover it over Sarah's face. Sarah screams that she can't breathe. Charlie continues while Sarah struggles. Sarah goes silent while Charlie continues to suffocate her.The scene switches to Charlie looking blankly into space while sitting in the gloom of the living room.

With the founding member Ross Knight finding inspiration from the Bulldozer he drove on the family farm in country Victoria, the band forged a unique sound and image that resonated with punk rock fans everywhere. Iconic label Sup Pop! released their second album when the band fell into the 'Seattle' scene of the late 80's amidst the likes of Pearl Jam, Mudhoney and The Melvins. Never quite finding the mainstream success of their grunge counterparts, the band managed to tour heavily in the USA and Europe thanks to a large and devoted fan base. The Cosmic Psychos were notorious for their ability to drink pubs dry, earning them a reputation that resonated around as a warning - Never drink with the 'Psychos. But it wasn't all shits and giggles. A heavy falling out with drummer and founding member Bill Walsh resulted in a line-up change and a bitter dedication on their new album with the song 'Kill Bill'. They've been ripped off by several record labels, and dealt with the tragedy of the passing of guitarist Robbie Watts in 2006. But the band continues through all its adversity to remain strong to this day with Dean Muller on drums and John 'Mad Macca' McKeering from the Onya's taking care of the guitar duties. COSMIC PSYCHOS : BLOKES YOU CAN TRUST follows the bands colorful history, as well as the enigmatic and entertaining founding member Ross Knight, to get behind the man who rides the bulldozer. Farmer, Father, Weightlifter, and frontman. His story alone, and told from his perspective is a unique portrait of an unlikely and revered rock and roll bloke.

When Budhia displays an uncommon talent for long-distance running, Biranchi nurtures his gift, heralding him as a folk hero for the impoverished masses, and maybe even for India itself. But after golden child Budhia breaks down during a world-record 65 kilometer run at the age of four, public opinion begins to turn on the guru and his disciple, and soon the two are swept up in a maelstrom of media controversy and political scandal. Following Budhia's roller-coaster journey over five years, Marathon Boy is a Dickensian tale of greed, corruption, and broken dreams set between the heart-racing world of marathon running, the poverty-stricken slums, and the political intrigue of a modernizing India. Nothing is what it seems in Budhia and Biranchi's story, and Atwal continually shifts viewer identification to tell both a shocking story of opportunism and exploitation, but also a touching portrait of an authentic bond between a parent and child.

The film opens with a shot of a majestic old house. We hear the beginning of the film's main musical theme, followed by a young boy in a voice-over calling young Alexander to join him to see an ancient city under the sea. Alexander tiptoes past his parents' bedroom, from where emanate a woman's giggles. Once outside the back door of the house, he runs on a short wooden walkway that ends at the beach, where he joins his two friends. He drops his short pants and they all three run into the sea and start swimming toward the open waters.Cut to Alexander (Bruno Ganz) as an older man, sitting in an armchair. He has just been awakened by his housekeeper, Urania (Helene Gerasimidou). This is the last day she says, Let me come with you to the hospital. Alexander, very philosophically, refuses and he thanks her for her three years of faithful service. She leaves the room, but promptly returns for an ultimate glance at Alexander, on the pretext of reminding him that his dog has eaten, before furtively leaving again. Alexander, now alone, finishes his cup of coffee. The camera moves to show the balcony, where the dog is lying down, and the sea panorama. Alexander turns on his record player which plays the film's theme for a moment. He turns it off, and looking through the window toward the harbor and then toward the adjacent building, he hears an echo of the same music coming from one of the apartments. Alexander says it happens every morning, and he wonders aloud who it might be and why.Alexander takes his dog for a walk along the harbor. As he walks, he reflects about how it all started with Anna (Isabelle Renauld), his dead wife, and how he had left so many of his projects unfinished. Alexander gets into his car and drives onto a main thoroughfare. At an intersection, street urchins take advantage of the red light to rush to the stopped cars and wash their windshields, hoping for tips. A young boy (Achileas Skevis) wearing an oversized yellow parka reaches for Alexander's windshield. The traffic resumes, police sirens are heard, and a group of policemen chase the young delinquents down the avenue. Alexander stops his car, opens the passenger door and shouts for the boy in the over-sized parka to get in. The policemen and the other boys run past his car as they watch: the boy has been saved from arrest. They turn into a side street where Alexander stops the car. He asks several questions in Greek to the boy, but the boy does not seem to understand. The boy, an Albanian refugee, gets out of the car, then turns toward Alexander, a stranger, with a big smile of gratitude before running off down the street (we never learn the boys name at any time during the film).When Alexander meets his daughter, Katerina (Iris Chatziantoniou), he tells her that he must go on a trip and needs her to keep the dog. She refuses, stating that her husband, Nikos (Vassilis Seimenis), does not want any animals in the house. Katerina asks her father about his third project, which was to complete the unfinished poem, Free Besieged, by Greece's National poet, Dionysios Solomos (1798-1857). Alexander replies that he hasn't finished it: Maybe I did not find the words? Alexander hands her a bundle of her mother's letters. One of them lacks an envelope, and he asks her to read it. It is dated 20 September, 1966, the day Katerina was born. She starts reading aloud, and soon we hear Anna, in a voice-over (Pemi Zouni), reading her own letter, full of nostalgia and regrets. Alexander's mind wanders back to that day some twenty years earlier. Anna's physical appearance is as it was on that day, but Alexander appears at his current age. Anna reproaches her husband for never being present, sharing his family's life, instead always traveling, physically or mentally, immersed in his books. Soon, Anna's mother (Alexandra Ladikou), father (Alekos Oudinotis), uncle (Nikos Kouros), and many other relatives arrive to see the new baby. They all run to the beach in front of the house, where Alexander's mother (Despina Bebedelli) is watching over newly born Katerina, asleep in her baby carriage.The reading ends. Alexander returns to the present, and is leaving when Nikos appears and tells him that they have sold Alexander's old house, which will be demolished, starting that very afternoon. Katerina tries to justify the sale, but Alexander does not want to listen to her excuses, and recalls aloud an event in her life, from the time when she was fifteen years old. Alexander leaves with his dog.As Alexander stops at a pharmacy to buy a painkiller, he looks across the street and sees the boy in the yellow parka and one of his friends being abducted by two men. He follows the men's car to an abandoned warehouse outside Thessaloniki. Soon, a bus full of middle aged people arrives. The people also enter the warehouse, and Alexander surreptitiously joins them. Inside, we see the boy and many other children, and we realize that these people are probably childless couples who came to buy some of the children. An older boy makes a break for it, and in the ensuing tumult, Alexander grabs the Albanian boy, pays the kidnappers, and walks out of the building with him.After driving a while, Alexander and the boy stop along the road at a bus stop. Alexander asks the boy if he has any relatives in Albania. The boy says he has a grandmother. Alexander negotiates with a bus driver to take the boy near the border. Alexander feels guilty in abandoning the boy, and he tries to explain to him that he, also, is going on a big journey today. As they walk together to the waiting bus, Alexander asks the boy what the words korphoula mou meant in a song the boy was singing. The boy gets on the bus, but as the bus barely starts rolling, it stops again, and he jumps out. Alexander decides to drive the boy to the border himself. On the way, he stops in a kafeneon and considers hiring a taxi to take the boy to the border. However, soldiers come in the kafeneon and the boys runs away. Alexander finds him terrified at a nearby street corner, and he finally decides to take him to the border himself.As they arrive at the border, in a landscape of mist and snow, the boy talks about the war he witnessed in his village and his escape to Greece with his friend, Selim. The border is a long, high fence to which many people are clinging, their limbs frozen. As Alexander and the boy walk toward the border, the boy admits that he lied, and that there is no grandmother on the other side. They run back to the car, pursued by an Albanian border guard. Later on, by the river, they stop for a sandwich from a food-truck. Alexander tells the boy about Solomos, who was born and raised on an Italian island. The camera, after a very long scan over the river, transitions to a man, the poet (Fabrizio Bentivoglio), dressed in 19th century garb. Although of Greek origin, he had been raised and educated in Italy. Inspired by the Greek rebellion against the Ottomans, he returned to his native island and wrote in Demotic Greek, the language of the common people. The legend tells that Solomos, not knowing this language well, used to buy Greek words from the peasants.Alexander and the boy drive into a village where there is a wedding procession in progress. It is led by an accordionist playing a Ponte piece of music (Ponte is a region in northern Turkey where a massacre of Greeks by the Turks took place in the 1920s, forcing the survivors to return to Greece). The bride follows, dressed in white, and she is in turn followed by the wedding party carrying some chairs. The groom appears from a doorway and, while dancing with his bride and followed by the wedding party, the couple goes to an open area surrounded by a high metal fence. Curious boys are hanging from that fence, in a manner reminiscent of the frozen people on the border fence. Alexander has come there with his dog. He meets his housekeeper, Urania, who reluctantly agrees to keep his dog for him.Alexander and the boy walk on the pier. Alexander, overcome and sick, sits on a bench. The boy says that he will go and get words for him. Alexander remembers a cruise he took with Anna and his family. Again, we hear Anna in voice-over, recalling her version of that day. Alexander's recollection continues with the same party as before, but they are now on the beach. He decides to climb to the top of a small cliff, and is reprimanded by Anna, who calls him a traitor. Alexander climbs anyway and explores the summit, where he finds a stone that has been engraved Christos, Vassillis, Alexander, Summer '39. He then goes to the end of the cliff and waves his handkerchief at a motorboat. A passing plane in the sky brings him back to reality on the pier, where a small group of people move by, carrying a young boy who had been drowning. Alexander meets his doctor, who was among the passersby, and says that he will enter the hospital tonight, as he had been told to do, when the pain gets to be too much.Cut to Alexander, searching inside a large building under construction for the Albanian boy, who has disappeared. He finds the boy, who is distraught over the death of his friend, Selim, the older boy who had brought him to Thessaloniki. Selim was run over by a bus, and his body now rests at the morgue. Alexander, the boy, and several of Selim's friends go to the morgue, and while Alexander distracts the guard, the boy sneaks into the chamber where Selim's body rests and steals his clothes. What follows is a ritual cremation of Selim's clothes. Many of his friends are hanging onto wooden fences, once more reminiscent of the scene at the border. A mournful clarinet music accompanies the ritual.Alexander goes to the hospital to see his mother: I came to say goodbye. But his mother does not hear him, as she is obviously affected by an advanced neurological disease and is only present in a physical sense. Alexander's previous dream of the family picnic on the beach continues. Soon, the sky opens up on the revelers and they all take cover, except for Alexander, who is looking for Anna, who has disappeared. He finds her alone by the sea. Back to reality, Alexander's mother collapses in his arms and he puts her back to bed. What follows is a touching soliloquy on the unfairness of life and Alexander's regrets.Alexander is walking alone in the night when the Albanian boy joins him and says that he is leaving tonight on a boat, heading for some unnamed destination. Stay with me, pleads Alexander, the boat does not leave for two more hours. They board a bus. Three men on bicycles, clad in yellow oilskins, drive by. They are alone until the next stop, Disembodied, where there is a street demonstration in progress, and a man with a red flag, obviously a participant, gets on board at the same time as a young couple who are arguing. The three bicyclists in yellow oilskins are riding alongside the bus. At the next stop, the couple leaves, and three musicians board the bus and begin to play. They get off the bus at the next stop, Conservatory, where the poet, Solomos, gets on. He sits across from Alexander and the boy, and recites his unfinished poem, Easter Sunday. When Solomos gets to the unfinished last line of his poem, Sweet is the life...and,... he repeats these first few words, unable to complete the line. As he leaves the bus, Alexander asks, Tomorrow, how long does it last?Alexander and the boy get off the bus, as the three yellow-clad men ride pass them by again. Alexander drives the Albanian boy to the dock, where the boy joins his many friends into a tractor-trailer which motors off and disappears into the departing boat.Alexander drives away in his car. He stops in the middle of the avenue, at a red light. The light changes, but Alexander's car does not move. The camera shows him immobile, lifeless at the wheel. The traffic goes around him, leaving Alexander's car standing alone in the middle of the avenue. The light turns red again. Suddenly, the car accelerates through the light, at great speed, down the avenue. The next scene shows Alexander as he enters his old, empty house by the sea. In a voice-over, Anna reads the letter she is writing to Alexander, about her special day, Katerina's birth day. Alexander walks through the house, to the back and to the beach, where his family is standing by the shore, singing. Anna approaches him, and they dance. Soon the whole group dances, then fades away, leaving the couple alone. Alexander makes future plans, and says to Anna, One day, I had asked you, how long does tomorrow last? Anna answers, An eternity and a day. She leaves, and Alexander is left alone, facing the sea, speaking Greek words aloud: korphoula mou (my little flower), xenitis (exile), and argathini (very late in the night)."

The Isleno Trappers had been squatting on marshland for many years, trapping muskrat and mink, and when fur prices shot up, Perez made a shrewd land deal that enabled him to jack up the rent on the land. When the Trappers balked, Perez tried to push them off the land right before trapping season. He brought in mercenaries from Texas to enforce his eviction order, and violence erupted. One St. Bernard sheriff's deputy was killed in the gunfire, and Perez never set foot in St. Bernard Parish again."

A sniper patrol sets out to disperse a Taliban roadblock. On route to the road block, in a dried out river bed at the foot of the ridge, LCpl Stuart Hale detonates a land mine, losing his leg. Cpl Mark Wright is a mile away when he hears the explosion. He quickly forms a patrol and they run down the steep hill to help. They go to LCpl Hale's side knowing the potential danger they are in. They begin prodding the ground, clearing a path away from the casualty, to an area where a helicopter could land, then carry Hale on a stretcher to the landing site. Cpl Stuart Pearson turns back along the cleared path. As he bends down to pick up a water container, there is another explosion. Pearson is only four or five yards away but any efforts by the patrol to reach him would risk another explosion. Cpl Pearson applies a tourniquet and doses himself with morphine while they wait for the helicopter. It finally arrives, but as it gets closer they realise that it's a Chinook, not the winch craft that was requested. It lands more than fifty yards away across ground that is likely to be covered with mines. There's no question of carrying the casualties to the Chinook. No one moves. The helicopter lifts off empty - its downdraft sets off another mine, blasting shrapnel into the shoulder, chest and face of Mark Wright. Medic LCpl Paul Hartley moves forward to help. He throws his medical pack on the ground in front of him to detonate any mines in his path. He reaches Wright safely. As he moves to the casualty, Fusilier Andy Barlow moves back to give him room, treading on a mine that severs his lower leg. The blast also blows Hartley to the ground and wounds Pte Dave Prosser. The only way the wounded and the stranded can escape the minefield is if they are lifted out, but there doesn't appear to be a helicopter readily available. Despite wounds to his arm, neck and chest, Mark Wright continues to maintain command and keep up his men's spirits, reassuring them that rescue is on its way. Three hours later, two American Black Hawk helicopters arrive to lift the men out of harm's way. On the helicopter, Cpl Mark Wright dies, having successfully coordinated the rescue of his injured comrades. Corporal Wright was posthumously awarded the George Cross."

Lord Mark (Alex Jennings), a sophisticated aristocrat with a large estate, begins to court Kate with Maude's approval. However Kate is secretly in love with a young muckraking journalist named Merton Densher (Linus Roache), whom her aunt has forbidden her from pursuing a relationship with because of his humble circumstances. Nonetheless she has continued to meet with Merton in secret, though he is growing increasingly impatient for her to leave her aunt and marry him.Aunt Maude confronts Kate about her continuing association with Densher and threatens to withdraw her financial support from Kate and her father. Kate reluctantly breaks with Merton and refuses to meet with him anymore. A few months later, at a dinner party given by her aunt, Kate is introduced to the wealthy American orphan and heiress Milly Theale (Alison Elliott), who is on an extended trip through Europe with her travelling companion Susan Stringham (Elizabeth McGovern). The cynical Kate is captivated by Milly's beauty, vivaciousness and humor, and the two form a strong friendship. Kate and Merton reconcile and resume their secret meetings; one day they run into Milly and Kate introduces Merton as a friend. Soon after Milly invites Kate to accompany her and Susan to Venice.Before leaving town, Lord Mark secretly reveals to Kate that Milly is terminally ill and that although he desires Kate he has to marry Milly to avoid losing his estates.

Kate expects that the orphaned and lonely Milly will leave him her fortune after her death.During Kate's, Milly's, and Merton's excursions through Venice, Kate gradually becomes jealous of Milly's attraction to Merton, so much so that she lures him away one night to have sex. Milly confronts her the next morning, though Kate denies that Merton is her lover. She realizes that she must leave, without warning Merton, if her scheme is to succeed. On their own in Venice, Merton's affection for Milly grows ever stronger and the two form a strong bond, even as her condition worsens. One day Merton spots Lord Mark at a cafe; alarmed, he goes to visit Milly but is denied entry. Susan visits him and Merton realizes that Kate has revealed their secret to Lord Mark to sabotage the whole scheme, knowing that Mark would tell Milly as revenge for her jilting him. Nonetheless Milly agrees to see Merton and the two share an intimate moment where she forgives him and says that she still loves both him and Kate, despite their actions. A few days later, Milly dies and Merton and Susan attend her funeral.A few weeks later, Merton returns to London where on one rainy evening Kate comes to Merton's flat. She asks why he has not come to see her in the weeks he has been back and finds a letter from Milly's attorneys, informing Merton that Milly did indeed bequeath a sizable portion of her estate to him. Merton tells Kate that he will not take the money, and she must marry him without it if they are to be together. She agrees, and they make love.

The movie opens by showcasing the daily lives of the four student friends. The students soon meet the politician, Kumar, who also runs a roadside dhaba frequently visited by the students.In many subsequent scenes, the students get into trouble with the local residents. In one such instance in the dhaba, the politician comes to their rescue and hence they get in touch with each other. Later that night, however, one of the students is attacked by some of the local residents. The other students become furious, chase the locals, and a fight ensues. Meanwhile, Vijay's ex-girlfriend is harassed by Ramanathan. This is witnessed by Karthi, who confronts and physically assaults Ramanathan and then narrates these events to Vijay. Later, to their surprise, Ramanathan's friends wait in the dhaba to ambush Karthi. Ramanathan, who has little luck with love, yearns for one college student who seems to be the ex-girlfriend of Lenin Vijay. One night, the four friends get very drunk and accidentally annoy some of the caste fanatics.

This film takes that principal but instead of deceiving, the story invites you to watch the main characters dream away. With True Dreams, Allen takes the term dream sequence to a whole new level: he lets his audience in on the joke, while they watch the two main characters run around unaware of the reality/fantasy of their surroundings. It's pretty clear from the start that Colby and Liz have both fallen asleep and are dreaming. But whose dream is it? And which city does this dream take place in, New York, or Baltimore? Within the context of these dreams, we also see flashbacks of how the couple met and ultimately broke up.

There are many success stories and also some failure stories in this region. This film intended to discuss various case studies in an entertaining fashion.
This is a story of a youngster who is frustrated with his financial growth in his traditional occupation of weaving clothes. Lack of proper job prospects in his hometown and the peer pressure to make riches he chooses to migrate to gulf region. He falls in trap of a middle man who promises too much and swindles money from him for the visa.

This film is an effort to bring attention towards their contribution, their sacrifices and respect they deserve, to the larger audience. This film also explains how lack of understanding the law of the land will bring troubles to the migrants.

He is found by local villagers who nurse him back to health. Within the small village(Dongmakgol), time appears to stand still. They have no knowledge of modern technology, such as guns and grenades. All villagers are unaware to the conflict within Korea.Meanwhile, not far from the village, a platoon of North Korean and South Korean soldiers have an encounter, and the ensuing gunfight leaves most of the North Koreans dead. The surviving soldiers from the North manage to escape through a mountain passage. The North Korean soldiers, Rhee Soo-hwa (Jeong Jae-yeong), Chang Young-hee (Lim Ha-ryong), and Seo Taik-gi (Ryu Duk-hwan) are found by an odd girl Yeo-il (Kang Hye-jeong) who acts crazy. She leads them to the village, where to their astonishment, they find two South Korean soldiers Pyo Hyun-chul (Shin Ha-kyun) and Moon Sang-sang (Seo Jae-kyung). The South Korean soldiers who, have both deserted their units had also been lead to the village which is housing the injured U.S. Navy pilot, Smith by a different villager.The unexpected encounter causes an armed standoff that lasts for several days. The villagers have no idea what the stir is about, and wonder why the two sides are standing there pointing those sticks at each other. The confrontation ends only when a soldier holding a grenade is worn by fatigue and accidentally drops it. Another soldier heroically throws himself onto the grenade, but it does not explode. He discards the dud over his shoulder in contempt, and it rolls into the village storehouse and blows up the village's stockpile of corn for the winter. The remnants fall down from the sky surrealistically as popcorn.The two groups of Korean soldiers and Smith now have to face the fact that their quarrel condemned the village to starvation in the following winter. They help the villagers in the fields to make up for the damage they have caused, and even work together to kill one of the wild boars that trouble the village. Tensions between the two groups of Korean soldiers gradually lessen, though members of both sides are haunted by the memory of terrible things they have experienced during the war.While this is happening, Allied commanders, who have lost several other planes in the area, are preparing a rescue team to recover Smith, whom they mistakenly believe has been captured by enemy units and is being held at a hidden base. The plan: when the rescue team finds and recovers Smith, a bomber unit is to fly in and destroy the anti-aircraft guns they presume are sited in the village, which means that the innocent villagers are now in grave peril.The rescue team, led by their commander (David Joseph Anselmo), drops in by parachute at night, suffering heavy casualties from the rough terrain. They enter the village, and under the assumption it is a cover for an enemy base, begin roughing up toward the villagers. Despite the efforts of the villagers to conceal the Korean soldiers by disguising them as villagers, a firefight breaks out in which all the members of the rescue team but one are killed and Yeo-il is fatally wounded by a bullet. The only survivor of the rescue team, the Korean translator, is hit over the head by Smith and is captured by the villagers.Through the translator, the people in the village find out about the bombing plan. The North and South Korean soldiers realize there is no time for Smith to make it back to his base to stop the bombing. The only possible way to save the village, they decide, is to create a decoy enemy base using equipment from the rescue team parachute drop, so that the bombing unit will attack them instead of the village.Smith is sent back along with the surviving rescue party member so that he can tell the Americans that there is nothing in the village to bomb, in case they decide to send more bombers. Meanwhile, the decoy is successful, and the remaining North and South Korean soldiers die smiling while a barrage of bombs explode around them. The village is saved, but at the cost of the lives of the former enemies who had later become friends."

Odd Number is a story of redemption set in South Africas Cape Flats, a low lying area south west of Cape Town, a human dumping ground for Apartheid eras forced removals of black and coloured people from 1948 to 1993. During this time, hundreds of labelled non-whites were forced from their homes into undeveloped, dusty pieces of land. With little or no education, and no existing infrastructure or local economy, these areas withered. For years the Cape Flats have been ravaged by gang violence, drugs and crime, as some of South Africa's poorest do what it takes to survive.
Rashaad is the man in the midst of it all, trying to make sense and dying to make the right decision."

He makes several attempts to approach established star actor Arun Chatterjee (Prasenjit Chatterjee) to essay the hero's role (played by Uttam Kumar in the original) but is continually spurned by Arun's associates Ashish (Pijush Ganguly) and Partha (Dwijen Banerjee).Over time, Arun receives a severe jolt to his ego caused by a public putdown from successful producer Manoj Sarkar (Biswajit Chakraborty) on a TV channel. He decides to take it upon himself as a challenge to unilaterally churn out a hit movie, gets to learn of Shubhabrata's script and summons him. Enthused by Shubhabrata's passion and determination, he decides to finance the movie himself, besides playing the lead, and arranging for its production, overruling Ashish and Partha's objections. The film appears to him the ideal platform to prove his ability to deliver a hit single-handedly.After scouring among a few actresses for the lead actress' role (played by Sharmila Tagore in the Ray original), Shubhabrata decides to cast his live-in girlfriend Srinandita (Nandana Sen), Srin in short, an actress involved in translated European theatre, who he'd always had in mind while delineating the character in his script. After initial reservations, Srinandita agrees.Manoj comes to learn of the launch of the film and apporaches Shubhabrata with an offer to help out in case Arun subsequently falls out with Shubhabrata for some reason and decides to shelve the film, but is dismissed.While shooting progresses, Shubhabrata encourages the growing bonding between Arun and Srin in the interest of authenticity in the film. At the same time, however, he himself grows both in confidence and arrogance towards his cast and crew.Now the narrative of the film's storyline begins playing out parallelly in real life where the friendship between Srin and Arun grows to the extent that she turns from his companion into confidante. In a climactic moment, after the last day's shooting is over, Arun invites himself into Srin and Shubhabrata's apartment in a drunken state while the latter is away and confesses to having used an aspiring actress on the casting couch. Srin consoles him saying that his feeling of guilt signifies repentance and holds the promise of redemption.Accidentally, the confession gets recorded on Srin's handycam who's been using it to rehearse for her next stage appearance as Antigone. When Shubhabrata, who has meanwhile been searching for novel ideas to publicize his film, learns of its existence upon his return, he sees a golden opportunity to use it as publicity material and decides to grab it with both hands. Srin is aghast at the suggestion and dissuades him, extracting a promise from him to refrain.However, Shubhabrata soon breaks his promise, steals the clip from Srin's possession unbeknown to her and passes it on to a TV news channel. When Srin learns of this, she leaves him for an uncertain career as drama teacher in a girls' school away from the city.The next day, the channel plays the clip repeatedly and when Arun switches on the TV, he chances upon the clip. He holds both Shubhabrata and Srin guilty of betrayal and when Srin calls him trying to explain and apologise, disconnects. Asish fails to convince him to take legal action against the channel and assault Shubhabrata.When he finally confronts Shubhabrata and learns of Srin's departure, he realises her innocence. However, he decides to cancel the film, and warns Shubhabrata of using his influence to finish his career, short of causing him physical harm.As a final denouement, Shubhabrata, though he is shown to have begun missing Srin, is seen fixing an appointment with Manoj. The outcome of their meeting is however left undepicted, resulting in a partially open ending."

He has gained fame in his area for helping people out with the help of methods he learns from films.During a nature camp which Anju attends, a hidden cell phone camera records Anju removing her clothes and showering in the bathroom. The culprit, Sameer Sam Deshmukh (Rishabh Chaddha), is the son of Inspector General of Goa Police, Meera Deshmukh (Tabu). Sam comes to blackmail Anju for sexual favors. Nandini pleads with Sam to leave their family alone, but Sam refuses to delete the video clip unless his sexual demand is fulfilled.

In the morning, when Vijay returns from work, Nandini tells Vijay about the incident and he devises a way to save his family from the police. He removes the broken cell phone and disposes of Sam's car, which is seen by the corrupt Sub-Inspector Laxmikant Gaitonde (Kamlesh Sawant), who has a grudge against Vijay. The next day, Vijay takes his family out on a trip to Panjim, where they visit an Ashram, watch a movie, and eat at a restaurant. Meera, realizing that her son has gone missing, starts an investigation.After a preliminary investigation, Meera calls Vijay and family for questioning. Having predicted that the police would come calling eventually, Vijay coaches his family on how to face the interrogations without raising suspicion.

Vijay produces bus tickets, movie tickets, lodging and restaurant bills as proof for the family's visit to Panaji. Meera questions the owners of the establishments they have been to and their statements prove Vijay's alibi. Meera realizes that on the day of the incident, Vijay had taken the tickets and the bill, made acquaintance with the owners and had gone for the trip with his family the next day, thus proving his alibi and making the owners unwittingly tell the lie.Meera has the Salgaonkar family arrested, and Gaitonde uses brute force to beat the truth out of them though Vijay, Nandini and Anju resist. Meanwhile, Meera finds out about Sam and his video of Anju from Sam's friend, Alex. Eventually, Anu gives in and reveals that she has seen a body being buried in the compost pit. After digging the compost pit, the authorities find the carcass of a dog.

The Sub-inspector is suspended, Meera resigns from her post, and the entire investigating team of the Police Station is transferred out, with the case now requiring authorization from the court. When Nandini asks Vijay about what he did to the body, he refuses to tell her, saying that the information is safe with him. Meera and her husband Mahesh (Rajat Kapoor) meet Vijay at a seaside to ask forgiveness for their rude and violent behavior and to get a confirmation whether their son is alive or not. They also reveal that they would be leaving for London to live with their relative. Finally, Vijay cryptically confesses to killing Sam .

What does it mean for a woman to lose her parents and make a family of her own, only to end up alone? What does it mean to move from country to country, from language to language? A Woman is a cinematic essay about identity. A search into the wounds of exile and a reflection on the function of memory. A haunting and intimate portrait of the director's own mother. It is the story of an imitation artist, trying to adapt to the challenges of real life... as a woman.

Then an old pickup truck comes hauling out of the mine shaft and down a desolate rural road. The driver is a bearded elderly man (Oliver Cooper) obscured in the darkness of his truck's cabin. He looks down at the passenger seat and touches a ghost trap that's holding a spirit. His truck is being chased by an unseen creature that is eventually able to sideswipe the vehicle and send it crashing into a cornfield. The man stumbles out into an open field in front of an old farm house. He gets to the porch and turns around and holds up the trap baiting the unseen spirit in the corn field. The old man is Egon Spengler and he readies a foot pedal switch as invisible steps are seen advancing in the dirt across the field. When it is in position, Egon stomps the pedal and several electric towers begin to activate. But they short out before powering on the device they were intended for and Egon quickly goes inside and shuts the door. He hides the trap in a compartment under the wood floor and then sits in a chair with his PKE meter. As fog fills the room, his PKE begins to light up and it's arms extend reminiscent of when a ghost is present. Egon is attacked in his chair and the PKE meter falls to the floor and turns off. A spirit orb is seen leaving the house from outside. Back in the house, the PKE meter activates again eluding to a new ghost nearby.We meet Callie (Carrie Coon) and her kids Trevor (Finn Wolfhard) and Phoebe (Mckenna Grace) as they are getting evicted from their apartment. Callie gets notice that her father has passed away in his farmhouse in Oklahoma and takes the kids with her to collect anything of value including the home. They find a dilapidated house full of clutter. As they're looking around, Janine (the Ghostbusters' receptionist) walks in and tells them that Callie's dad (Egon) had a lot of debt and a valueless farm. The ground begins to shake in what appears to be tremors from an earthquake, and the family huddle under a table. Phoebe spots the PKE meter under the chair her grandfather was in when he died.Callie takes Trevor and Phoebe into town to eat after she admits to them that they will be staying there for a while until she can figure out what to do. They find that it's a very small southern town where everyone knew of the mysterious man they all called the dirt farmer since there was no evidence he ever grew any crops. Trevor applies to work at the burger joint because he is smitten with the girl who works there named Lucky (Celeste O'Connor).In the following days Phoebe begins exploring the farm while using the PKE meter. She notices a chess board with an initial move made so she makes a move from her side of the board. Callie starts Phoebe in summer school and meets her teacher Gary (Paul Rudd) as she drops her off. Gary is just there to collect a paycheck and has the kids watch VHS's of old horror movies (the first one being Cujo (1983)) while he sits in the back doing research on the ongoing tremors in the area. Phoebe impresses him with her knowledge on Seismology and he explains to her that the tremor wave patterns don't match up with typical earthquakes from history. Phoebe also meets a boy in her class who calls himself Podcast (Logan Kim) since he's always recording for his show with his microphone.Back at the farmhouse, Phoebe sees that another move is made on the chess board and begins playing the ghost as the chess pieces begin moving in front of her. The ghost leads her downstairs by turning on lights until she finds the ghost trap under a floor panel. She takes it to Gary where he explains what it is based on his knowledge of the famed New York siege from 1984. He shows her and Podcast old footage of the Ghostbusters commercial on YouTube. They rig the trap to a school bus battery to get it to open. They succeed and a ghost resembling one of the demon dogs from the original flies away.Revelations come to fruition as Trevor finds Ecto-1 in the barn under a tarp and Phoebe finds Egon's lab in the basement. They both realize that their grandfather was a Ghostbuster and begin to take matters into their own hands. Phoebe repairs a proton blaster with help from Egon's invisible ghost and takes it out for a test with Podcast tagging along. Upon firing it, they hear a rustling in a nearby warehouse. They find the metal eating ghost named Muncher. They attempt to wrangle and capture him but fail. Meanwhile, Trevor repairs Ecto-1 and takes it for a joy ride where he comes upon Phoebe and Podcast who tell him what they were doing. The trio take off to capture Muncher in Ecto-1. They chase him thru the city and destroy tons of property with the proton gun. They succeed in capturing it with Egon's RC car mounted ghost trap. All the chaos alerted the police and they are subsequently pulled over and put in the town's holding cell. During their time at the jailhouse, Phoebe uses her one phone call option to call the number of the Ghostbusters from the commercial. Ray Stantz answers and explains that the team broke up after they had ostensibly eliminated all the ghosts. He and Egon had a falling out after Egon stole all their equipment claiming Gozer could still bring the end of the world. Phoebe tells him that Egon was killed a week ago before she is abruptly cut off by the sheriff claiming her phone time is up. Callie and Gary -who were out on a date during all of this- show up and bail them out.Phoebe confronts her mom for not telling her who their grandfather really was. Callie counters with the history she had with her dad. She wasn't into science like he was and felt like they never bonded and he didn't care about her. That's why he left them and became a recluse on the Oklahoma farm she concluded.The kids -feeling there's got to be a reason their grandfather would sacrifice everything to live on a farm in the middle of nowhere- find in his lab that his dirt farm was actually a field of hundreds of ghost traps meant to capture Gozer. They realize that his trap must have failed and set off to investigate the mine shaft once more. By this time Lucky has become close with Trevor thru work and the discovery that she is the sheriff's daughter. So she tags along to the mine with Trevor, Phoebe, and Podcast. They discover the root of all the tremors is the fact that the mine is actually a portal to the evil dead and every time Gozer attempts to raise the hoard of ghosts -along with the twin demon dogs- a series of 4 seismic activated proton guns that Egon rigged up inside turn on. They automatically cross beams and suppress the constant attempts of the ghosts trying to escape. This was the source of the recurrent tremors everyone in town was experiencing and holding Gozer back was the insurmountable task Egon had taken on alone since no one else believes him.That same night, Gary goes to Walmart to pick up some ice cream after his unusual date with Callie. He discovers several mini StayPuft marshmallow men roaming the store causing chaos like a bunch of gremlins. He comes upon the demon dog he released earlier and gets chased out to his car and attacked just like the scene from Cujo. Back at the farmhouse, Callie finds the hidden lab and discovers that her father Egon had a memory board of all her life on the wall. Just as she realizes that he truly cared about her, the other demon dog finds her in the lab and possesses her.The kids come home to reveal their discovery to Callie but find her possessed, before she jumps out the window and runs off towards the mine shaft. She finds Gary, who has already allowed the ghosts to start escaping by damaging the auto-proton guns that were keeping them at bay. The two merge energies in the mine. The kids retrieve Ecto-1 from the police impound with Lucky's help. Phoebe and Podcast are able to get the RC ghost trap and proton blaster out from the weapon holding cell by reaching in and releasing Muncher who immediately eats away the bars and escapes.They arrive at the mine and witness Callie and Gary transforming into the demon dog forms with Gozer sitting between them. Phoebe steps out from hiding to talk to and distract Gozer while Podcast controls the RC trap and captures the demon dog possessing Callie. This releases her from dog form as she passes out. The kids escape in Ecto-1 with Callie as the Gary -still possessed in dog form- chases after them.They make their way to the farmhouse and attempt the same trap as Egon. Callie and Phoebe stand on the porch holding the ghost trap with the demon dog that Gozer needs to become fully resurrected. Gozer appears out of the corn field and Phoebe tries to turn on the traps but they fail again just as they had the first time with Egon. Some mini StayPuft marshmallow men sabotage the equipment inside Ecto-1, which allows Gozer to release the demon dog from the ghost trap. The freed dog possesses Lucky. Just as Gozer, now back to full strength, is about to kill Phoebe, she is hit with a proton blast from behind. It's Ray Stantz who had just arrived with Peter Venkman and Winston Zeddemore! The three original Ghostbusters cross the beams and fire at Gozer. She appears subdued but then begins uncrossing the beams and blasts the Ghostbusters back causing them all to fall down. Gozer approaches them as Peter jokingly complains about the inherent troubles in their relationship. Just as she reaches them she is again captured by a sole proton beam. This time it's Phoebe, whose aim is being guided by the ghost of Egon. This is the first time his image is revealed to the audience.The other three Ghostbusters jump up and join the battle by firing their beams as well. With the combined force of four beams once again, Gozer is suppressed but not captured. Meanwhile, Trevor and Podcast have been able to defeat the mini-Pufts and repair the sabotaged equipment, allowing Trevor to emerge from Ecto-1 and fire his proton beam at the electrical capacitors. The burst of energy charges them up. Callie throws the switch to try to turn the traps on again, and this time they successfully activate, capturing Gozer and the demon dogs.The other three original Ghostbusters stare in amazement at the sight of the ghost form of their fallen comrade. They watch as he says goodbye, fixes Phoebe's glasses -identical to his- and gives Callie a hug. Having reconciled with his family, Egon's form fades and dissipates into the night sky. Lucky and Gary break free of the frozen dog carcasses, and the three surviving original Ghostbusters become acquainted with the Spenglers, before Winston tells them that he will fix up Ecto-1, and the three original Ghostbusters take it and their equipment back to New York City. We see an overhead shot of Ecto-1 driving with emergency lights on across a bridge in New York City as the theme song Ghostbusters begins.There is a mid-credits scene where Dana Barrett Venkman (Sigourney Weaver) tests Peter Venkman's psychic powers with the same patterned cards and electro-shock machine Peter had used in his University research before he became a Ghostbuster, and a post-credits scene shows a brief conversation between Winston, who is now the wealthy head of his family, and Janine, in which Winston mentions that he has been using his resources to maintain the Ghostbusters' properties, including Ray's Occult Bookstore and the fire station that had originally served as the Ghostbusters' headquarters. This is followed by Winston opening the fire station's door to allow Ecto-1 to be driven back inside, after which we see a shot of the basement's containment system with a blinking red light."

Screen legend Tony Curtis himself claims he's never been happier than he is now. Meeting the young, beautiful Jill Vandenberg in 1992, he could not have imagined how much she would change his life. An award-winning equestrian, Jill grew up loving horses and broke down in tears at her computer one day upon discovering how each year over a 100,000 horses of all ages, often in the best of health, are being brutally slaughtered for human consumption overseas. Right then and there Jill knew her life's purpose. And when she told Tony - who rode in many films - the terrifying fate of these horses, he offered to do all he could to help her rescue them. Jill and Tony Curtis are a fascinating couple whose double-life adventures, though non-stop, never distract them from what matters most. Join them in a great variety of experiences, including an actual slaughter auction in Utah (never before filmed, since cameras are forbidden); Tony's private art studio in Nevada, where the acclaimed painter transforms a blank canvas into a work as colorful as his conversation; a celebrity convention in Los Angeles that includes Debbie Reynolds and Angie Dickinson; the many happenings at Shiloh, the horse rescue they founded in a desert valley not far from Las Vegas; and their visit to the nation's capitol-where, along with Bo Derek, Jill and Tony share their compassion to persuade representatives and senators to vote for a bill to stop the slaughter of horses in America. Whether feeding an infant burro with a giant baby bottle or telling anecdotes about Marilyn Monroe to captivated students, Tony never loses his legendary humor. All leads up to Jill and Tony truly knowing fulfillment as they celebrate the rescue of their 400th horse.
