--
MISTER SOUL - A STORY ABOUT DONNY HATHAWAY descends into the soul of legendary American soul singer Donny Hathaway, who is seen by many musicians as an inspiration and genius. At the time of his greatest success, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, which didn't stop him from continuing to make harmonious music. How did he balance between his madness and genius? Can there be such a thing as too much talent?Music magazine Rolling Stone called Hathaway a soul legend and Justin Timberlake thinks he is the best singer of all time. Yet few people will remember Donny Hathaway as Roberta Flack's duet partner, Stevie Wonder's predecessor or the composer who managed to mix jazz and gospel into lavish soul music. His suicide in 1979 at the age of 33 by a fall from his hotel room has condemned him to the status of a 'musician's musician'.The documentary follows the same path of life as Hathaway himself: through a poetic journey embarking on cities like St. Louis, Chicago and New York, MISTER SOUL plunges deeper and deeper into Hathaway's life, up until his tragic end. Besides his brother and sisters, singer Roberta Flack, preacher Jesse Jackson and producer James Mtume, among others, talk about the genius and madness of the singer."

They wrestle with these unsettling times, trying to understand what is right and wrong, what is necessary, what they should believe in, and what they can do. We talk to sons and daughters of soldiers in Iraq, a high school political cheerleading team that protests war, children of activist parents, and cadets at a military boarding school. From ages 4 to 18, they are Caucasian, African-American, Latino, East Asian, East Indian - a portrait of the diversity of America. They speak out passionately on 9-11, the Iraq War, and their hopes and fears for their future. They demand answers: When is war justified? Does protest work? What is worth dying for? Is world peace possible? They express themselves through words, drawings, and play-acting. War in the 21st century will be determined by the children of today. At a time when we are debating the merits and justifications of war, this is a timely and important film, one that reflects on what we're teaching the next generation, and on what they have learned.

The king is amazed because Sky was such a lethal fighter. The king sets aside the spear and orders the official reward to be granted: a lot of gold, a lot of land, and the right to approach within 20 paces of the king to have a drink with him. The king asks Nameless to explain how he defeated Sky.We flashback to a chess hall where royal guards from Qin attempt to arrest Sky. Sky beats them all, mangling their swords and telling them to go away. As he is about to walk out, Nameless appears and announces he is there to arrest Sky. Sky does not believe him, feeling confident from his recent victory. The two have a fight (which is extremely fast and amazing to watch!) and find that they are evenly matched. Nameless pays a blind man to play music while they fight. While the music is playing, Sky and Nameless imagine the fight in their minds. This goes on until the strings on the harp-like instrument break and the two fighters open their eyes back to reality. Nameless launches into Sky fast enough to cut through Sky's spear and stab him. The royal guards witness all of this.Back in the present, Nameless presents two swords to the king: the weapons of Flying Snow and Broken Sword. The king declares that Flying Snow and Broken Sword tried to kill him 3 years ago. They hacked their way through entire armies of his men to get to him--but their attempt failed and they escaped. Since then, the king has kept all people 100 paces away from him and he has never taken off his armor or known a single night of peaceful sleep. With the proof of their deaths in front of him, the king orders the official reward for Nameless.For killing Broken Sword and Flying Snow, Nameless is rewarded with more gold, more lands, and the right to approach within 10 paces of the king to have a drink with him. The king asks how Nameless killed the assassins. Nameless explains that the two were lovers but the couple had a falling out 3 years ago. Nameless says he used their troubled relationship to drive them apart.In a flashback to a calligraphy school in the land of Zhao, everyone wears red. Broken Sword is a calligraphy master. Flying Snow is in the scene as well. Also at the school is a young woman named Moon (Ziyi Zhang), Broken Sword's servant. Nameless hires Broken Sword to draw a scroll eight feet tall and four feet wide with a single character on it: the Chinese word for sword. But Nameless explains that (due to the complexities of Chinese written language) there are 19 ways to write the word sword. Nameless asks for the 20th variation.We cut briefly back to the king, who is perturbed that the languages have gotten so complex. He proclaims that his ideal is to unite the lands and people as one country and establish a single written language. Nameless explains that sword play is much like calligraphy and he knew if he could have an example of Broken Sword's calligraphy, he would learn the secret to defeating his sword-fighting ability. The scroll is revealed and displayed behind the king. The king looks at it and asks Nameless to continue.At the calligraphy school, while Broken Sword is working on the scroll, the archers of Qin attack. This is a visually spectacular scene as millions of arrows are fired at the school. Flying Snow and Nameless look at each other and decide to stop the arrows, which are piercing the walls and killing students. Flying Snow and Nameless leap on to the roof and deflect the rain of arrows to save the school. Though many have already died, they stop any further arrows from harming anyone. The legendary archers of Qin retreat and make camp, preparing to attack again in the morning.Nameless reveals to Broken Sword and Flying Snow that he is a soldier of Qin and challenges them both to a duel. He takes the scroll that he has paid for and says if they accept his challenge to meet him at the army encampment the next day. That night Nameless meditates on the scroll. Broken Sword (knowing the scroll will reveal his weakness to Nameless) makes love to Moon (knowing that Flying Snow is watching) and is killed by Flying Snow for his betrayal. Moon tries to avenge her master but is killed by Flying Snow in another beautifully colorful fight scene amongst a shower of yellow leaves. The next day at the army camp, Nameless tells the soldiers to back off so he can have his fight with Flying Snow. Nameless and Flying Snow fight, but she is so emotionally distraught by all that has happened that he easily wins. The soldiers witness Nameless killing Flying Snow.We cut back to the throne room. There are strange torches between Nameless and the king that flicker in perfect unison. The king announces that he does not believe what Nameless has said. He does not believe that Broken Sword and Flying Snow were that emotionally immature. The king goes on about his suspicions. Looking paranoid, the king suspects that Nameless was working with the assassins all along. This was all a plot to put Nameless within 10 paces of the throne so he can kill the king with some awesome technique that Nameless must have. He suspects that Broken Sword and Flying Snow were willing to die for this since they tried to kill him before.In the scenes depicting the king's version of the story, everyone wears blue. Nameless presents himself to Broken Sword and Flying Snow. He displays a phenomenal technique that can kill everyone and everything within 10 paces of him, saying he used this technique to kill Sky. Nameless explains he can use this to kill the king but the only way to get close enough is to collect the reward for killing Broken Sword and Flying Snow. Nameless says he only has to kill one of them in front of the soldiers and they will believe his claim that he killed them both. Broken Sword and Flying Snow must decide which one of them will die by his sword. The next day Broken Sword and Flying Snow are walking towards the camp when Broken Sword attempts to injure Flying Snow. She is faster than him (suspecting he would try this) and she injures him instead, saying she is going to die and wants only for him to continue living. He is now too injured to stop her and so they have a tearful farewell. Flying Snow goes to the camp, fights Nameless, and dies. Nameless then shows up at a lake where Broken Sword is mourning Flying Snow. Out of honor, Broken Sword attacks Nameless; they fly over the lake as they fight. They are evenly matched, but Broken Sword stops fighting, gives Nameless his sword, and allows Nameless to leave.We cut back to the throne room as the king finishes his interpretation of what happened between Nameless, Broken Sword, and Flying Snow. The flames flicker in unison again. Nameless says your majesty is very perceptive. The king says he knew because the movement of the flames is a warning of murderous intent. The king, realizing that the man sitting 10 paces from him could kill him at any moment, asks who Nameless really is. Nameless says that he is an orphan from Zhao whose family was slaughtered by the armies of Qin. He perfected his sword technique throughout his life in order to one day avenge his family. Nameless then tells the king what really happened.We now have a flashback of the truth! In scenes with actors clothed in white, Nameless displays his technique for killing anyone within 10 paces and also shows that he can use this technique to miss every vital organ but still make the stab seem fatal; he did this to Sky. The truth is that Sky still lives! But the royal guards will think (and report) that Sky is dead. Nameless only needs to perform this move on Broken Sword and Flying Snow in public; they won't die and Nameless will have his opportunity to kill the king. Flying Snow agrees, but Broken Sword refuses.The king is shocked to hear this but it is the truth. Broken Sword does not want the king to die for reasons that he does not explain. Flying Snow attacks Broken Sword. She accuses him of ruining the opportunity they had to kill the king 3 years ago, and she won't let him ruin this plan as well. Nameless intervenes in the fight enough to distract Broken Sword so that Flying Snow can wound him. With Broken Sword wounded, Moon attacks Nameless but it is obvious that Nameless is a better fighter, so Broken Sword tells her to stop. The next day, Nameless uses his technique to apparently kill Flying Snow in front of the soldiers.The day after all that, Broken Sword confronts Nameless and confirms that Flying Snow is all right. Broken Sword gives Nameless his weapon to make it look like both Broken Sword and Flying Snow are dead so the plan will work...but he still begs Nameless not to kill the king. Nameless asks why. Broken Sword writes two words in the sand and walks away.Somewhere in all this (sorry, I don't remember where), Flying Snow arranges for a spy to watch over Nameless. She asks that this old man wave a red flag outside the palace if the assassination is successful, or a yellow one if the assassination fails. She needs to know, because her family was killed by the Qin armies as well. She believes she cannot die in peace unless she knows the king is dead.Back in the throne room, the King asks Nameless what two words Broken Sword wrote. Nameless answers our land. The king then asks how Nameless planned to kill him without a sword. Nameless answers by taking yours. The king realizes there is nothing else he can do--so he takes his sword out and throws it to Nameless. The sword stabs into the floor between them. Then the king tells Nameless about the attempt on his life 3 years ago.In the last flashback, Broken Sword and Flying Snow fight their way into the palace and kill hundreds of soldiers to get to the throne room. There, Broken Sword fights the king in the throne room while Flying Snow holds off the guards to keep anyone from helping the king. The king turns out to be quite a fighter but Broken Sword wins nonetheless. However, at this moment, Broken Sword sees something in the king's stare and decides to spare him. Flying Snow is shocked by this. They make their escape and we assume their relationship was never the same again.Back in the throne room, the archers have gathered in the doorway to kill Nameless but the king knows they cannot stop Nameless. The king stands up and turns his back to Nameless, saying he is ready to die because he realizes that Broken Sword did not kill him because Broken Sword understood the king's goal: to unite all kingdoms under heaven and end all the wars and suffering in all the lands. The king says he can die happy, knowing that someone like Broken Sword could understand his vision, and thus there is hope that others will make it happen in the future. The king stares at the scroll that Broken Sword wrote and further realizes that the ultimate ideal of swordsmanship is to have no sword.Nameless uses his deadly technique, flies through the air...and hits the king in the back with the sword's hilt. Nameless tells the king to remember this lesson: that a ruler must know when to use a sword and when to lay it down. A ruler must know that the goal of swordsmanship is to make peace. Nameless then walks out of the throne room. The guards surround Nameless every step of the way but they do not attack him.Outside the palace, the old man that Flying Snow recruited as a spy comes running out waving a yellow flag. Flying Snow turns to Broken Sword and accuses him of ruining another assassination. She demands to know what he said to Nameless. Broken Sword tells her it was just two words: our land. Flying Snow doesn't understand what this means; she attacks Broken Sword and they fight. Finally, Broken Sword invites her to attack. When she does, he deliberately drops his sword! She stabs him through the heart and cries wondering why he didn't block her. She wraps her arms around him from behind, wanting to be with her lover forever. She pushes the sword through both of them. They both die.Back at the palace, the soldiers still don't attack Nameless because they are waiting for the king's order. The king stares after Nameless with admiration, but his advisers demand that he have Nameless executed. Nameless tried to kill the king; therefore he must be made an example of so that no one else will try this and the king will be safe. The king knows they are right but he does not want to do it. The advisers shout in unison Your Majesty, execute him! several times. Nameless reaches the courtyard gates and turns around to face the king. The king silently, reluctantly gives the order and the archers launch a huge volley of arrows at Nameless, who does not try to deflect them. He is killed.A body is carried as if in a royal funeral; captions explain that the Nameless Hero was executed as an assassin but buried as an honored hero. The king of Qin eventually did conquer all the kingdoms and unite them under his rule. He went on to oversee the building of the Great Wall of China. On the closing screen, the following is written:To this day all the people of China refer to their country as...Our Land."

It was a personal story that dealt with my heroin/methadone addiction and my attempt to quit this long-term habit. My way forward involved a gruelling 36-hour hallucinogenic trip with the radical, unlicensed, detox agent called ibogaine (aka iboga in its more raw state). It wasn't a particularly pleasant experience but I found the drug virtually killed off all my withdrawal symptoms overnight. Ive been free of addiction ever since...some feat after 15 years of opiate dependence.I was overwhelmed at the reaction to Detox or Die. I've collected many personal testimonials of former drug addicts who have successfully quit after watching the film. I frequently receive letters, emails and Facebook posts from people eager to emulate my journey. Iboga Nights is my mission to further explore the underground ibogaine scene through the network of treatment providers that exist. It is a journey in which I go from Glasgow to London and Holland following the stories of addicts who take ibogaine and the providers who work with this unlicensed and extremely potent drug. I gained unprecedented access to both the practitioners and the addicts seeking help and I believe this film will shed light on and ask questions of this little-known and unlicensed drug. Several key before-and-after stories play out within the film.In Amsterdam we meet Sara Mama Iboga - the most experienced and respected ibogaine practitioner in Europe. She has been treating addicts in the spare room of the family home in a respectable suburb of Amsterdam for 15 years. Two long-term heroin addicts, Ian and Paul make the journey from Glasgow to Amsterdam to undergo care in Saras home. This Ibogaine treatment session takes a turn for the worse when Ian has a seizure and is rushed to hospital.But for every failed treatment there are several success stories. Eleanor beat her heavy morphine and diazepam addiction after just one iboga session. Shes now gone on to be global supporter of iboga herself!Some call it a cure for drug addiction. While this may be a bit exaggerated it certainly has been effective as an addiction interrupter and there are many testimonials, including my own, which serve to support this. Nevertheless, I'm left questioning the efficacy and safety of iboga, especially after Sara is jailed on a manslaughter charge after a client tragically dies after a treatment.The tension really hits a high though when I visit a young man doing a self-treatment with iboga. Sid needs to quit a life-threatening pill injecting habit and iboga may be the answer. Its a gruellingly long night sitting with Sid as he takes the capsules. Whether I like it or not I'm involved with this guy's treatment session and have to take responsibility if it goes wrong.Iboga Nights is a director/narrative led, self-shot documentary. Included will be expert scientific analysis of the potential benefits or pitfalls of such a controversial therapy through the research evaluations of Dr Ben Sessa and various others. It is an inspiring film journey that asks serious questions about drug addiction, its treatment in the UK and just how viable the alternative routes are.David Graham Scott Nov 2013"

can Stretch one's SoulA 1970s New York City setting finds Indian-born immigrant Ram Patel trying to establish himself in the turbulent city-life where he encounters various hurdles that prevent him from obtaining his goals of becoming successful and wealthy. The pursuit of the American dream becomes littered with pot-holes for the earnest protagonist Ram Patel. Arriving from the airport to stay with a family friend, he finds himself instantly disliked by an African-American landlord (Floyd) that attempts to make Ram miserable. Pounding the pavement for a job, Ram is taken-on by a CPA firm run by a strict, former military crew-cut martinet who hires other Indian men like Ram to do countless hours of accounting grunt-work in a hot-box dingy office. With no money to save, he begins to borrow heavily and digs himself into insurmountable debt. In the midst of this self-inducedmisery, he sends for his wife & daughter from India and continues his façade of a successful appearance to his newly arrived wife by going into even further debt on more newly printed credit cards and latched-onto friends. These friends and co-workers begin to get irritated by his lack of commitment to payback, and this leads our protagonist being pressed into self-doubt and constant searching for both a way out and purposeful meaning in his life. Proclaiming to push ahead through his frustration and predicament is based more onstubbornness than enlightenment, where a dont quit mind-set becomes fuel- to-the-fire for his out-of-control situation. Ram has his car stolen, and he becomes enslaved to his increasing debt status, which makes his wife question his responsibility as a husband, father and a man. RAMs wife RANI becomes pregnant again, and he must reluctantly send her back to India to deliver their new child due to a lack of medical insurance in the USA. Rani protests, but Ram mentions financial suicide as to their status, and Rani goes back to India for the birth of their second daughter.
Into the life of Ram Patel comes an eccentric array of characters who swirl his life into confusion. A colleagues mother offers her connection to a spiritual Holy-man known as DADA BHAGWAN, whose followers revere him as mentor and benevolent wise master, professing the release of ego for enlightenment. Ram passes up this spiritual growth opportunity, instead trying to make his way on a fortune- seeking venture in a new business with a puffed-up, egotistical entrepreneur named ADESH.Ram continues spinning-his-wheels and finally tries an introductory session with the eminent Dada Bhagwan. Confronting himself is an intensely difficult proposition, but awareness comes suddenly like lightning and Ram turns over a new leaf as the situation begins to eventually swing in Ram Patels favor.This compelling story addresses the overall-immigrant experience of the midtolate 20th Century, where culture- clash and making it in America are the pillars under which many lives are built, or crushed by! The films ultimate message and Ram Patels plight and subsequent transformation by Dada Bhagwan become the hook whereby any individual can absorb the bracing impact of undeniable fate that results in a firmly entrenched never-give-up attitude. Old and young alike will feel a positive, uplifting cathartic reaction to Desperate Endeavors."

tt1355568,Generation RX,Generation RX,0,2008.0,81,Documentary,7.2,233.0,Kevin P. Miller,"International award-winning filmmaker Kevin P. Miller announced today that the release of his
new film, GENERATION RX will occur on Tuesday November 11, 2008. GENERATION RX
addresses many of the key issues surrounding the use of ADHD drugs, antidepressants, and
anti-psychotic medications among children and teenagers worldwide.
For decades, scores of doctors, government officials, journalists, and others have extolled the
benefits of psychiatric medicines for children, said Miller, the films writer and producer.
GENERATION RX presents the rest of the story and unveils how this era of unprecedented
change in Western culture really occurred and what price has been paid by our society.
By employing the expertise of internationally respected professionals from the fields of
medicine, ethics, journalism, and academia, Kevin P. Miller investigates whether collusion
between drug companies and their regulatory watchdogs at the FDA exists. He also focuses
on the powerful stories of real families who followed the advice of their doctors and faced
devastating consequences for doing so.
GENERATION RX is a film about families who confronted horror and found nowhere to turn
for help and how scores of children have been caught in the vortex of mind-bending drugs
at the earliest stages of their growth and development. This powerful documentary also
examines whether we have forced millions of children onto pharmaceutical drugs for
commercial rather than scientific reasons.
Ultimately, Miller says, Generation RX may help parents decide whether the perceived
benefits of these medications outweigh the serious risks to children.
Critics have already begun hailing the GENERATION RX as one of the best documentaries of
2008. Mike Adams, publisher of NewsTarget and Natural News says the film delivers a jawdropping
emotional ride, and weaves a terrifying tale of criminal conspiracy. It is on my list
as one of the best films of 2008. [D-Man2010]"

They regularly do various drugs paid for by such petty thefts as Harry pawning his mother's TV set. Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), Harry's mother, is a widow living alone in Brighton Beach who must regularly buy back her TV set from the pawn shop owner, Abe Rabinowitz (Mark Margolis). Abe tries to get Sara to turn Harry in, but she doesn't have the heart for it, as Harry is all she has left after the death of her husband, Seymour, twenty years prior.Harry and Tyrone eventually come up with a plan to make money by reselling heroin on the street so that they can get away from their dead-end lives. Over the summer, they make a fair amount of money. They talk regularly about buying a pound of extremely pure heroin as their 'big score' that will give them comfortable lives when they invest that money in a legal business.Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly), who is Harry's girlfriend, has a distant relationship with her parents (who are never seen on camera), but sometimes goes out with Arnold (Sean Gullette), her psychiatrist, in order to appease them. She, along with Harry and Tyrone, snort and shoot heroin and cocaine, drop speed, and talk a lot about their dreams for a better future. As Harry starts earning money, he and Marion talk about opening a clothing store where Marion can earn a living as a clothing designer.Meanwhile, Sara is a TV junkie, obsessed with an infomercial hosted by self-help guru Tappy Tibbons (Christopher McDonald), based on the acronym JUICE (Join Us In Creating Excitement). One day she receives a mysterious call from someone who claims that she has been selected to appear on a TV show. Thinking she's being invited to appear on the Tappy Tibbons infomercial, Sara is suddenly obsessed with the idea of flaunting Harry on the show before a national audience. She wants to wear a particular red dress that she wore at Harry's high school graduation; a dress that Seymour loved to see her in. However, she is now too overweight to fit into it. One of Sara's friends, with whom she sometimes sits outside her apartment, gives her a diet book; but of course the grapefruit and coffee diet leaves her constantly hungry. She then hears about a way to lose a lot of weight by taking certain medications from a doctor, so she decides to try it.Tyrone and Harry have made a lot of money by dealing drugs, gradually filling up a shoe box Tyrone hides in a wall in his apartment. Gazing at the money in the shoe box, he reminisces about running home and into his mother's arms before making love to his girlfriend.As summer progresses to fall, so do the debilitating effects of the drugs that Harry, Tyrone, Marion, and Sara use. The money that Harry and Tyrone had saved starts to dwindle. First, Harry buys Sara a large, new TV/entertainment set. Tyrone gets caught in the middle of a drug gang assassination, lands in jail and needs to be bailed out. While visiting Sara to tell her about the new TV set he's gotten her, Harry finds out that the diet pills that Sara is taking are methamphetamine 'uppers,' or 'speed,' and warns her of the dangers involved. However, Sara delivers a passionate monologue about how her upcoming television appearance is giving her a new lease on life. Harry leaves in a taxi, shattered emotionally by his mother's situation, but he won't do anything to prevent her addiction growing.Eventually, Tyrone, Harry and Marion all run out of both drugs and money. Without money they cannot buy more drugs. Harry pleads with Marion to ask Arnold for $2,000 so that Harry and Tyrone can make a purchase from a notorious mob figure. As Marion fears, Arnold wants her to sleep with him in return, and she reluctantly complies with Harry's acceptance. At the site of the drug deal, a scuffle breaks out among buyers trying to push ahead in the line, and the supplier opens fire before driving away, leaving several people -- Harry included -- without any drugs.Sara loses weight gradually, the zipper on her dress coming tantalizingly closer to zipping up completely. But she also develops a tolerance for the pills that lead her to continually increase her dosage without consulting her doctor, and she slips into drug-induced psychosis that causes her to experience hallucinations involving her refrigerator, which get more and more intense. Sara begins to regularly hallucinate that she is the guest of honor on Tappy Tibbons' infomercial and gets to speak with the man himself.Harry's relationship with Marion starts to crumble when the need for drugs starts to overcome their sensibilities and the love they have for each other. Marion blames Harry for the failed purchase from the mob figure. After one major fight, Harry gives her a phone number for a major dealer named Big Tim (Keith David), who he heard about from Tyrone. Harry and Tyrone couldn't buy from Tim because he was more interested in 'pussy' than money. Harry also discovers a black spot on his arm where he injects the heroin.Fall fades into winter. As a result of increasing drug gang violence and police crackdowns, Harry and Tyrone cannot find any heroin in the city, so they decide to drive to Florida to make a purchase. Marion goes through severe deprivation withdrawal and she tearfully begs Tyrone and Harry's regular contact, Angel, for help, but he rebuffs her because she is broke. In desperation, she calls Big Tim and goes to his house. Although she is hesitant for a moment, she gives him a blow job in return for a fix. Pleased with her performance, Big Tim invites her to a big orgy event at his house later in the week.The invitation for Sara to appear on TV has not arrived, and her hallucinations with the refrigerator reach a climax as she takes more and more pills, thinking they will make the refrigerator stop. But instead, she finally hallucinates that the refrigerator lurches through the kitchen straight towards her and opens a wide toothy mouth. Sara runs from her apartment in fear, wearing no winter coat even though shoveled snow lines both sides of the streets. She wanders in a stupor, gets on the subway and finds her way to a Manhattan television station, begging to know when she will be on television. The receptionist and TV executives stall for time so they can contact paramedics who take her to a mental hospital.As Harry and Tyrone are headed to Florida, the black spot on Harry's arm grows to an alarming size and he begins complaining about the pain. Tyrone drives Harry to a hospital. One look at Harry's arm and the triage doctor knows that Harry is a drug addict. He discreetly excuses himself taking all drugs with him and calls the county sheriff's department, taking the medicine and drugs which were previously lying around with him, just in case. Tyrone and Harry are arrested and sent to jail, where Tyrone is subjected to racist guards and punishing work detail. Harry uses his phone call to contact Marion. She begs him to come home right away, and he promises her he will, but she knows he is lying. As they speak on the phone, Marion is getting dressed up to attend Big Tim's party.At the mental hospital, Sara refuses treatment and refuses to eat, and her psychosis only deepens. Still delusional, she unwittingly and unknowingly signs an authorization for doctors to put her through electro-shock therapy.While clearing prisoners for work detail, a prison doctor finds Harry's arm has become almost completely black and gives off a foul odor, and the pain is too much for Harry to bear. He is sent to the prison infirmary, where the doctors quickly determine they must immediately cut off Harry's arm at the shoulder to save his life.At Big Tim's party, Marion engages in a variety of sex acts including an 'ass to ass' with another woman.Harry has a dream of running toward a smiling Marion as she waits for him on a Coney Island pier, and then awakens in a hospital ward with a beautiful, kind nurse (Lianna Pai) watching over him. Hearing him speak Marion's name, the nurse promises to contact her and arrange to have her come see him. But Harry knows she will not come; he knows he's lost her.Marion arrives home from Big Tim's party, clutching a large plastic bag to her breast; she's been paid very well and Big Tim likes her enough to be her supplier as long as she pleases him. She lies down on her couch and smiles blissfully.Tyrone and several other prisoners are ushered into a common cell after work detail and Tyrone lies down on a cot, exhausted, with only a pillow and no blanket.Two of Sara's friends visit her at the mental hospital, and are so horrified and shocked at the sight of her as a hollow shell of her former self that they sob uncontrollably in each others' arms while waiting for their bus back home.All four main characters are shown curling up in a fetal position: Harry in the hospital bed with his arm amputated, Marion on her couch after gaining a regular drug supplier in return for her favors, Tyrone on a cot in prison as he dreams of his childhood and his mother, and Sara in a bed at the mental hospital.The movie closes with Sara having another hallucination where she is a grand prize winner on the Tappy Tibbons show, wearing her red dress and looking beautiful; showing off Harry, who in her dreams, has become a successful businessman engaged to marry Marion, to a cheering audience."

She gets out of her car and shoots one of the donkeys until it is dead.We meet David (Colin Farrell) as he checks into the Hotel with his brother, who has been turned into a dog. In the City, people are given 45 days to find a romantic partner or else they are to be turned into an animal of their choice. David meets with the Hotel Manager (Olivia Colman) and says he would like to be turned into a lobster since they live to be 100 years.During breakfast, David observes three women - the Heartless Woman (Angeliki Papoulia), who is said to have no emotions; the Biscuit Woman (Ashley Jensen), who is always seen with a small pack of biscuits; and the Nosebleed Woman (Jessica Barden). David becomes acquainted with two men - Robert (John C. Reilly), who speaks with a lisp; and John (Ben Whishaw), who walks with a limp. Later, during an assembly, John is called up to speak. He says that his father left his mother for another woman, and so she was turned into a wolf and brought to live in a zoo. He would visit her enclosure until he climbed in to give her a hug. The other wolves attacked him, leaving him with his limp, but two wolves stayed still, and he figured one of them was his mother.Throughout their stay, the singles attend dances to meet one another. They are also given extra time by going on hunts and finding Loners in the woods to tranquilize. The Heartless Woman is said to be the best hunter due to her cold and unfeeling nature. On the bus ride to the hunt, David sits next to the Biscuit Woman, who propositions him and then says she may jump out the window of her room.Masturbation is restricted at the hotel, and so the men can only receive moderate sexual stimulation (without orgasm) from the Maid (Ariane Labed). The Hotel Manager finds out that Robert was masturbating repeatedly, and she forces him to have his fingers burnt in a toaster as punishment. Meanwhile, John pursues the Nosebleed Woman by faking a nosebleed problem by banging his face against something. They eventually fall in love and are moved to a bigger room for the two of them.The Biscuit Woman jumps out her window and is left on the ground, bleeding and screaming in agony.

The two are then moved into the bigger bedroom, though David must continue pretending to be as heartless as she is. They run into John and the Nosebleed Woman, along with a little girl named Elizabeth (Laoise Murphy) assigned to be their daughter. John tells Elizabeth to give David a kiss, but he responds by kicking her in the shin so she can limp like her dad.One morning, the Heartless Woman tells David she killed his brother by kicking him repeatedly. She has blood on her leg. David pretends to be unmoved, but when he sees the dead dog in the bathroom, he starts crying, and the Heartless Woman slaps him for lying. She goes to tell the Hotel Manager, but, with help from the Maid, David tranquilizes the Heartless Woman and drags her into the transformation room to be turned into an unknown animal.David flees from the Hotel and goes into the woods where he meets a group of Loners; a rebel group against the establishment. The Loner Leader (Lea Seydoux) welcomes David, but tells him that any romantic interaction is forbidden and is punishable. David sees one man with bandages on his mouth. He is told that the man was given the red kiss, in which he had his lips cut off, along with another woman who suffered the same fate, and they were forced to kiss each other. The worse punishment is said to be the red intercourse, which one can only imagine as to how it goes.During his stay there, David falls for the Short-Sighted Woman (Rachel Weisz) (who narrates her encounters with David).

Based on the internationally acclaimed book Hana's Suitcase which has been translated into 40 languages, the film is an effective blend of documentary and dramatic techniques. In addition to tracing the lives of George and Hana Brady in the 1930's and 40's, Inside Hana's Suitcase tells the present-day story of The Small Wings, a group of Japanese children, and how their passionate and tenacious teacher, Fumiko Ishioka, helped them solve the mystery of Hana Brady, whose name was painted on an old battered suitcase that they received from Auschwitz, the notorious Nazi death camp built in Poland. The film's plot unfolds as told through contemporary young storytellers who act as the omniscient narrators. They seamlessly transport us through 70 years of history and back and forth across three continents, and relate to us a story of unspeakable sadness and also of shining hope. For this is a Holocaust story unlike others. It provides a contemporary global perspective and lessons to be learned for a better future. Directed by award-winning filmmaker, Larry Weinstein, Inside Hana's Suitcase is a powerful journey full of mystery and memories, brought to life through the first-hand perspectives of Fumiko, Hana's brother George, and of Hana herself.

While Jacob is optimistic about the life ahead, his wife Monica is disappointed and worries about their son David's heart condition; due to this he is frequently told not to run. Jacob and Monica work sexing chicks at the nearby hatchery and argue constantly while David and his sister Anne eavesdrop.To help watch the children during the day, they arrange for Monica's mother Soon-ja to travel from South Korea. David, who is forced to share a room with her, avoids her because she does not conform to his idea of how a grandmother should be. Still, Soon-ja attempts to adjust to life in the States and bond with the children.The well that Jacob dug runs dry. Jacob is reluctant to pay for county water, but eventually is forced to do so. He runs into additional difficulties, such as the vendor in Dallas canceling their order at the last minute. Even so, he perseveres despite Monica's vocal desire to return to California. This strains their marriage closer to breaking point.Meanwhile, Soon-ja takes the children to plant minari seeds by the creek. She tells them how resilient and useful the plant is, and predicts plentiful growth. David finally begins to warm to his grandmother after she teaches him card games, bandages his wounds, and soothes him to sleep. Soon-ja also encourages him to do more physical activity, something his parents discourage, saying that he is stronger than they think.Soon-ja suddenly suffers a stroke overnight. She survives with medical treatment, but is left with impaired movement and speech.Jacob, Monica, Anne and David head to Oklahoma City for David's heart appointment and to meet a vendor to sell Jacob's produce.

An emotional, brutal, and honest account of what really occurred on the ground in the waning hours of the war that defined a generation of Americans.Sarah Verardo, the wife of a catastrophically wounded Afghanistan Veteran, wanted to do all she could to help the people her husband had fought for and with, to include his interpreter. Chad Robichaux desperately wanted to save his interpreter Aziz before he was killed by the Taliban, as his friends had been already. So they did what the military community always does in times of crisis: they leaned on their friends. In short order, a team of twelve men, most of whom had never met each other before, had established a Joint Operations Center in the United Arab Emirates. Hours later, they were running flights into Kabul on C-17s donated by UAE, and 737s they procured themselves.These men knew the clock was ticking and that the United States Government was going to cease evacuations on 31 August, so the entire team, led by three ground team members that were going outside the wire to save those who needed help, worked with little to no sleep or food until the horrible moment when the IED went off, claiming 13 American and many more Afghan lives.This story pulls no punches and shares the ground truth of what it was really like in those final hours of the war."

After her husband (played by Priyanshu Chatterjee) Dibakar's tragic demise, Esha and Chandrima had none but each other. However, being the strong and independent woman that she has always been, Chandrima raised her daughter all by herself. Never did she let the absence of a 'male parent' affect their bonding, or so does she think. Time flies by and, as Esha grows into adulthood, distance starts to grow between the duo. It is only after a pregnant Esha's suicide-attempt that Chandrima realizes how little she knows about her daughter's life outside the house. Especially since college days, Esha got carried away in the newfound freedom. Whereas, Chandrima busy in her professional life, has failed to keep track of this change. Eventually, they had become, as Chandrima comes to admit, strangers under the same roof. Thereafter, Chandrima starts to introspect Esha's perspective and, in the process, discovers a side of her daughter she never knew. What follows is how she, with all the strength of her love, brings Esha back to a normal life. Esha too, comes to realize that Chandrima was always her closest friend; had been there for her and always will be.

tt0301083,Cardcaptor Sakura: The Sealed Card,Kâdokaputâ Sakura: Fûin sareta kâdo,0,2000.0,79,"Adventure,Animation,Comedy",7.8,1638.0,Morio Asaka,"Sakura Kinomoto has become the Clow Mistress and a powerful sorceress in her own right. At the age of ten, she accidentally found the Clow Book, containing the magical Clow Cards created by Clow Reed, and was tasked to capture them after releasing them from the book. Sakura succeeds in capturing the cards and became their master after recognition by their guardians Keroberos and Yue. In a second task, Sakura had to use her own magic to transform the cards in Sakura Cards or they would cease being magical, whilst challenged by Clow Reeds reincarnation Eriol Hiiragizawa. Sakura successfully transforms all the cards and becomes their true mistress. The series, which the film is a continuation of, ended with Sakuras rival-turned-friend Syaoran Li confessing his love to her before leaving for Hong Kong. Sakura remained unsure of how to respond, but her affection for Syaoran led to the creation of a brand new Clow Card, appearing as a winged heart but lacked a name.The film opens in the demolished remains of the house owned by Clow Reed/Eriol, but the site begins to tremor. A chair is launched up into the air and crashes back down, revealing a hole beneath where a glowing, unsealed Clow Card lies in darkness. The film cuts to night at Penguin Park in Tomoeda, Japan, where Sakura is practicing her magic against monsters created through the power of the Create Card, and is aided by Keroberos and Yue. The fight ends, and is revealed to be part of a video recording directed by Sakuras best friend and cousin Tomoyo Daidoji. Sakura, Tomoyo and Kero (the smaller form of Keroberos) watch the video in Sakuras bedroom. While Tomoyo and Kero celebrate the film, Sakura is embarrassed by it. Tomoyo skims through the Clow Cards, trying to decide which ones to use in the next video, with Kero objecting to the use of the Change Card, reminding him of its body swapping magic which caused trouble for him and Syaoran.The mention of Syaoran causes Sakura to blush, realising she did love Syaoran when she created the unnamed Clow Card. Syaorans voice catches her attention, revealing there is unrecorded footage still on the video of Sakura and Syaoran battling the Bubble Card. Sakura admits to Tomoyo that she does love Syaoran, and intends on telling him face-to-face like he did, gaining Tomoyos support. The next day, Sakura prepares to go to school, even though it is the summer, mainly because her class is performing a play as part of Tomoedas annual Nadeshiko Festival. After being teased by her big brother Toya, Sakura rollerskates to school, but ends up late for the rehearsal, where she is to play the role of a princess opposite Takashi Yamazaki who is playing the prince. The play was written by Naoko Yanagisawa. After school, Sakura and Tomoyo pass by where Eriols house was, now replaced with an amusement park, which will open soon. That night, Sakura rehearses a part of the play at home, but the words remind her of what she will have to say to Syaoran. At the amusement park, the unsealed card materialises above the parks clock tower, taking on the form of a young girl sporting wings. This is the Nothing Card.Sakura and Tomoyo visit the park, but Sakura senses the Clow Cards aura and runs into the park to find. She rounds a corner and collides with someone, who grabs her hand. Sakura apologises but is shocked when her saviour is noneother than Syaoran. Syaorans cousin Meiling runs around the corner, surprising Sakura even more. At Penguin Park, Sakura catches up Meiling who nearly lets slip that she and Tomoyo planned this reunion. Meiling whispers to Sakura that her engagement to Syaoran has ended, following a promise they made that they would end it if Syaoran found someone else who he loved more, namely Sakura. Syaoran asks Tomoyo if she was the one who invited them to Tomoeda, which Tomoyo admits to. She asks him if he wanted to see Sakura again, but he worries that his presence will now force an answer from Sakura. Meiling explains she is staying at Tomoyos mansion during their stay and has to decline Sakuras invitation to dinner since she is going to be busy with Tomoyo, but asks Sakura to treat Syaoran instead, much to Sakura and Syaorans surprise.After Tomoyo and Meiling deliberately make excuses to leave, Sakura takes Syaoran home though the atmosphere between them is awkward, until Sakura attempts to pluck up the courage to confess to Syaoran, only for her attempt to be crashed by Keros sudden appearance when he smells cake. Sakura dashes off to make dinner, leaving Syaoran and Kero to argue to the point that Kero transforms into Keroberos and pins Syaoran to the sofa, mocking him. After dinner, Syaoran and Kero nearly argue again, but Sakura scolds Kero. Sakura takes a second opportunity to confess to Syaoran, only for Toya and his best friend Yukito Tsukishiro, the human form of Yue, enter, with Toya raging upon seeing Syaoran. Syaoran leaves for the night, with Sakura seeing him off, promising to see each other at school tomorrow. Inside, Toya and Yukito have dinner, but Toya is moody because Syaoran returned. Upstairs in Sakuras bedroom, the Clow Cards glow, and the Change Card is stolen by the Nothing Card, unnoticed by Sakura and Kero.Syaoran and Meiling arrive at school where they reunite with their friends. Meiling goes to Tomoyo, expressing her disappointment that Sakura did not confess, but Tomoyo is pleased, hoping to be able to record Sakuras confession on her trusty video camera. Sakura arrives late again, and shyly says good morning to Syaoran. After school, Sakura and her friends walk through the park, with Meiling none-too-subtly to Sakura that she should pick the right time to confess to Syaoran, though Sakura remains dense to Meilings implications. The group go to buy some juice, but Sakura becomes puzzled by its location, previously using a now-absent mailbox to remember the right street. The group leave, failing to noticing the remains of the mailbox, as if it has been erased from existence.That night, Sakura writes a letter to Eriol, who left Tomoeda four months ago back to England with his friends Kaho Mizuki, Spinel Sun and Ruby Moon. Kero also wrote a letter for Spinel, his rival, after completing a video game that day. Sakura falls asleep, as another Clow Card is stolen by the Nothing. A montage follows in school as the class rehearses for the play, with Sakura and Syaoran spending most of the time staring at each other from afar. Sakura catches Syaoran out in the hall and tries to confess, only for it to be stopped when an army of students run by. Tomoyo presents the plays costumes to Sakura and Yamizaki, Sakura wearing a beautiful pink gown, and ends up sharing a far off look with Syaoran.That afternoon, Sakura and Syaoran are deliberately left alone together by Tomoyo and Meiling, only for Sakuras fourth attempt at a confession is interrupted by Toya dressed in a rabbit costume, promoting the festival. Yukito scolds Toya and forces him to buy ice cream for Sakura and the others. Sakura and Yukito sit together, with Yukito, who was Sakuras former crush, asking if she has confessed to her true love. Sakura admits she hasnt but will do her best, Yue giving her his support and that of Yue. Another Clow Card is stolen from Sakuras bag, but this time, Sakura senses the cards disappearance and checks her bag. In the park, Sakura tell Syaoran she felt an aura but assumes it was just her imagination. The group discovers a bridge in the park has disappeared. Sakura informs Kero of the missing bridge, but while waving it off, he tells Sakura to keep her cards on hand. Sakura receives a phone call from Meiling, inviting her to the amusement park tomorrow.The next day, Sakura is late for the meet up at the amusement park, with Tomoyo and Meiling vowing to get Sakura to confess at the park. In a montage, the group are shown enjoying the day, until Meiling decides to go onto the ferris wheel. Since it is only two people per carriage, Meiling and Tomoyo decide to share one, forcing Sakura and Syaoran to go together. On the ferris wheel, Tomoyo films the carriage that Sakura and Syaoran are in, who sit in their own in uncomfortable silence. Sakura takes the opportunity to tell Syaoran without interference, only for another Clow Card to be stolen. Sakura and Syaoran both spot it and pursue the card as soon as they can exit the ferris wheel.Sensing the aura Sakura felt on the day Syaoran returned, they follow it to the parks funhouse and realise there is a new Clow Card in the attraction. Sakura and Syaoran spot the Nothing Card watching them through a mirror and confront her. Sakura goes to use the Through Card and discovers it has gone missing. Before Sakuras eyes, the Nothing steals three more cards, asking that she return her friends. Sakura summons the Wood Card, but the Nothing steals the card as well before disappearing. Sakura informs Kero of what happened, but is interrupted by a phone call from Eriol, who is aware of what is happening.Eriol explains that the Nothing was created and sealed away by Clow Reed, and acts as a negative counterbalance to the combined powers of the fifty-two original Clow Cards. Now that all of the cards became Sakura Cards, the Nothings seal has been broken and she is stealing the cards to reclaim the balance between the cards creative powers and her own destructive powers. Eriol asks if part of the city have disappeared, causing Sakura to remember the missing mailbox and bridge. Eriol explains the Nothing will continue erasing things, even people, until she regains all of the cards. Eriol tells Sakura that she must seal and transform the Nothing into a Sakura Card, but it will come at a price, namely the love Sakura has for the person she holds most dear. Eriols phone line, which has been protected by an incantation all this time, is destroyed by the Nothing, ending Sakura and Eriols call. Eriol turns to his friends including Kaho Mizuki, who asks if he knows the outcome of the situation, but Eriol does not.The next day, the class finish a full rehearsal of the play, with their teacher Mr. Terada rallying everyone for the festival tomorrow. Sakura and Syaoran go outside where it is raining and Sakura explains everything Eriol told her to Syaoran. Sakura recalls that she was briefly trapped in a world without love when she faced the Final Judgement after capturing the Clow Cards, and admits she never wants to see something like that happen again. With no apparent way around it, Syaoran seemingly admits defeat. Sakura asks why he would throw away his love so easily, but Syaoran claims he would rather give up his feelings than see the whole city be destroyed. Hurt by these comments, Sakura runs out into the rain until she meets Yukito. When Sakura is unable to explain what is wrong, Yukito transform into Yue to make it easier for her and learns of the situation and gives Sakura a boost of confidence.The day of the Nadeshiko Festival arrives, but Sakura is upset by her situation. Tomoyo, Meiling and Kero are present, with Syaoran standing outside the door. The Nothing appears, stealing another card and leaving a large hole in the middle of the schools running track. Sakura uses the Sleep Card to knock everyone save herself and her friends out, but the Nothing steals Sleep before vanishing. The others wake up, but Yamazaki has hurt his arm, leaving him unfit to participate in the play. Mr. Terada suggests cancelling the play, but Yamazaki objects, telling everyone that Syaoran is a worthy replacement. That night, Tomoyo performs onstage at an amphitheatre before the townsfolk of Tomoeda, while both Sakura and Syaoran are worrying about both performing and the Nothing Card. Tomoyo ends her song and joins Sakura and Kero in a dressing room, telling her friends that every day should be lived well so that there are no regrets.At the amphitheatre, Sakuras father Fujitaka ends up sitting beside Tomoyos mother Sonomi, who he and his late wife Nadeshiko are related too. As the play begins, Sonomi has her bodyguards prepare large video equipment to record it. Sakura enters on stage with her friends including Meiling, Sakura playing a princess at a masquerade ball. The plays setting involves two nations battling for a magic stone, but the ball is to uphold peace. Sakura comments she is not a good dancer, but Meiling encourages her to take centre stage and look for a good dancer who will help her. Sakura admits she hates war, prompting Syaoran as a prince to step up and reveal his similar opinions. Syaoran invites Sakura to dance, though admitting he is not very good at it. The two dance onstage, with Kero, Tomoyo, Meiling and an angry Toya watching.The play continues, where Syaoran and Sakura are now alone, with Syaoran admitting he is a prince from the warring neighbouring country. Syaoran then confesses his love to Sakura, who is unable to accept her own love for the prince. Most of the onlookers are in tears at this point. Sakura tells Syaoran to erase his feelings of her from his heart and goes to leave in tears, only for the lighting to suddenly explode and the whole city shakes. Realising the Nothing is near, Sakura witnesses most of the Clow Cards being stolen by the Nothing all at once. Huge black orbs spread across the city, erasing great chunks of it, and the audience, Sakuras friends, Fujitaka, Sonomi and Toya are all caught in the Nothings power and disappear. Kero and Yukito transform into Keroberos and Yue, joining Sakura, Syaoran, Tomoyo and Meiling. Sakura decides she must seal the Nothing, and Syaoran agrees to go with her.Tomoyo chimes in, revealing she has made battle costumes for Sakura and Syaoran for the upcoming battle, believing Sakura will return from the fight with a smile. On a rooftop, the group observe the destruction caused by the Nothing. Sakura and Syaoran wear their new battle costumes, Sakura wearing a pink outfit with long gloves, and Syaoran wears a similar green-coloured outfit. The Nothing steals more cards, but Sakura tries using the Windy Card to divert the cards back to her, only for them all to be caught by the Nothing. The whole building shakes, and Sakura spots Tomoyo and Meiling being caught in one of the black orbs. Sakura races to save them, but Syaoran grabs her at the last moment, but their friends disappear. Keroberos and Yue realise the Nothing is hiding out at the amusement park, so the four fly to find her.The group land at the park and are immediately set upon by enchanted parts of the park. The Nothing tosses a Viking ship at Sakura, but she evades it by using the Jump Card, which allows her to jump great heights and distances. She leaps up to the rollercoaster but sees the Nothing moving a rollercoaster cart slowly down a hill before she steals the Jump. Sakura flees from the rollercoaster and uses the Time Card to freeze time. The Nothing begins to weaken Times power and steals it. Sakura falls from the rollercoaster but is saved by Keroberos. Yue leaps into battle and tries to shoot the Nothing with an arrow, only for it to be deflected by the Nothings shield, and Yue is consumed by her power. Keroberos follows, launching a blast of fire at her, and tries to strike her from the air, only to be consumed by the Nothings power too.Syaoran concludes the Nothing can erase the magic made by Clow Reed. Sakura panics, asking what they should do, but turns and finds Syaoran has vanished. Syaoran chases the Nothing who has fled to the ferris wheel. Syaoran leaps onto it to confront her and fires a lightning-based attack at her from his sword, hoping it will convince her to become a card. Sakura runs over, as the Nothing activates its power, obliterating the ferris wheel and taking Syaoran with it. Sakura uses the Fly Card, sprouting wings, and flies to try to save Syaoran, but fails. Realising everyone she loves is gone, Sakura cries and pursues the Nothing as she flies back to the clock tower.Sakura flies up to confront the Nothing, but she steals the Fly Card, causing Sakura to fall down the tower. She grabs onto the clock towers giant pendulum and uses the Shield Card to defend herself when the Nothing breaks the pendulum in two. The pendulum drops to the ground, but Sakura makes it to a staircase spiralling the tower. Syaoran is revealed to have survived the Nothings power and crouches at the bottom of the tower. The Nothing confronts Sakura, glad that she has collected all of her friends. Sakura threatens to seal the Nothing, but she objects, trying to swallow with her powers. Trapped on a ledge, Sakura is approached by the Nothing who asks her why she is trying to take her friends from her, lamenting that she was imprisoned in darkness for so long. Sakura shouts at the Nothing, telling her stealing the cards is no way to make friends. The Clow Cards all escape the Nothing, who asks if they hate her. When the cards return to Sakuras side, she collapses and bursts into tears.The Clow Cards form a bridge for Sakura to walk to the Nothing. Sakura walks over to the Nothing, telling her that everything will be alright, and invites her to join her fellow cards out of friendship. The Nothing silently accepts, so Sakura uses her Clow Staff to seal the Nothing, lamenting she was unable to tell Syaoran how she felt. However, as the Nothing turns into a card, her powers suddenly surround Syaoran instead of Sakura. Syaoran realises he was chosen instead of her because he had more magic left, but promises Sakura even if his feelings for her are erased, he will fall in love with her all over again. Syaoran is consumed by the Nothings power, causing Sakura to cry. However, the nameless card she has flies out and intercepts the Nothings magic.Sakura sobs to herself that Syaorans love is gone, only for the nameless card to float down to her, revealed to her fused with the Nothing, and has gained a name The Hope Card. Sakura notices Syaoran looking at her, so she takes the opportunity to confess to him at long last. Syaoran does not react, causing Sakura to start crying again.

Worse, the modern stereotype America has about Native Americans is limited to the oppressed drunkard or the fat casino cat, neither of which deserves understanding nor empathy. No matter what kind of image is evoked, you cant win if youre Native: A successful Indian exploits the American way by not giving back his fair share and a downtrodden Indian cant pull himself up by his boot straps no matter how much government assistance hes given. Native Americans are blamed for not taking responsibility for the plight of their people and told that they dont deserve help or money despite the fact that Native Americans have the highest poverty rates and the lowest access to health care of any race in the United States. But when we look beneath the stereotypes and understand the issues and statistics of whats really happening in Indian Country, the truth is surprising, complex, and frustrating. There are spiritual, psychological, and physical wounds experienced in large numbers of the Native American population and these hurts have a name, Historical Trauma. The theory of Historical Trauma stemmed from research done by Dr. Maria Yellowhorse Braveheart in her own community during the 1980s. Dodging Bullets, confronts Historical Trauma head-on through interviews and discussions with young Native Americans whose lives are stricken by plights known to be effects of Historical Trauma. The film explores research professionals whose work helps develop a better understanding of Trauma, how it relates to Native Americans specifically and provides insight into ways we can improve the outcomes of Native people dealing with these challenges. The individuals shown in the film come from a variety of social and economic backgrounds: for example, a middle-school student living on the poverty stricken Blackfeet Indian Reservation battling an addiction to meth, a hardened enforcer of the A.I.M., who has leaned the importance of love late in life to a successful author/professor teaching the Ojibwe language to university students."

However, Naval investigator and lawyer Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway (Demi Moore) suspects that Dawson and Downey, who were otherwise exemplary marines, were carrying out a Code Red, an unofficial act of discipline in which soldiers are submitted to methods akin to bullying in order to get them to improve their performance, toe the line or follow procedure. Santiago compared unfavorably to his fellow Marines, being clumsy and lagging behind on exercises and was socially ostracized. He denounced Dawson in an attempt to be transferred away from Guantanamo.Dawson and Downey are taken to a military prison in Washington D.C. to await trial. Galloway requests to defend them but the case is given to Lieutenant Junior Grade Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise), a U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps lawyer who is inexperienced in courtroom litigation, but has a reputation for arranging plea bargains, which gives him time to devote himself to his passion for softball. It is indicated that he has a psychological fear about having to match up to his late father, Lionel Kaffee, a leading attorney, who is regarded as one of the great trial lawyers of recent times. Galloway manages to get herself appointed as Downey's lawyer, thus playing a part in the proceedings. The third member of the defense team is Kaffee's friend Lt. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak), who is a top legal researcher.Kaffee meets with the defendants and finds that they are of the strictest type of Marines - those that serve in a forward area (on the line between their country and an enemy country) and are required to take their duties very seriously. Dawson is tough and authoritative and believes in honor and duty. Downey, a simple-minded young man and an archetypal village idiot, is guided solely by his devotion to being a Marine and his dedication to his superior, namely Dawson.Kaffee, Weinberg and Galloway fly to Guantanamo Bay to examine the crime scene and to meet with the base commander, Col. Nathan R. Jessup (Jack Nicholson), his executive officer, Lt. Col. Matthew Markinson (J.T. Walsh) and Santiago's commanding officer, Lt. Jonathan Kendrick (Kiefer Sutherland). Pressed by Galloway, Jessup denies that Code Reds, which are against military guidelines, are practiced but makes little secret of the fact that he sees them as a good way of enforcing discipline, especially on the front line. Jessup also tells them that he arranged for Santiago to leave the base for his own safety once his denunciation of Dawson became known but that he died before he could leave. At one point, Kaffee casually (and with regard for military decorum) asks Jessup for a copy of Santiago's transfer order. Jessup says he'll comply but also hostilely demands that Kaffee ask with the proper acknowledgment of Jessup's rank as a colonel. Kaffee is cowed into complying and Jessup happily agrees.When the defense team returns to Washington D.C., they learn that Markinson has gone AWOL and is unlikely to be found since he is a veteran intelligence operative who can cover his tracks.Hours before Santiago's death, Kendrick assembled the platoon and told them that they were not to touch him. However Dawson and Downey now tell Kaffee and Galloway that Kendrick subsequently met with them again and ordered a Code Red on Santiago. They never intended to kill him, just to shave his head in order to teach him a lesson, but he died as a result of a rag being shoved into his mouth as a gag.The prosecution is led by Marine Captain Jack Ross (Kevin Bacon) who is a friend of Kaffee's. Ross makes no secret of the fact that he has been given a lot of leeway by his superiors to close the case since Colonel Jessup is expected to take up an important post with the National Security Council (NSC) and this could be put in jeopardy due to the Santiago affair. In fact, Kaffee may have been appointed specifically because of his reputation for plea-bargains and the hope that the case would never make it to court. Ross offers a deal which will see Dawson and Downey serving just six months in prison. When Kaffee puts this to the defendants, however, Dawson regards such a move as cowardly and dishonorable and rejects it, knowing that he and Downey will be dishonorably discharged from the corps. He believes that he was doing his job and obeying orders and wants to make this point in court even if he and Downey end up serving a life sentence. Seeing Kaffee as nothing more than a coward for making the deal and trying to avoid fighting the case, Dawson refuses to salute him when he leaves the room.Failing to understand Dawson's stubbornness, Kaffee at first decides to resign from the case, but after thinking things through he agrees to go ahead. At the grand jury hearing, he enters a plea of not guilty for his defendants. He, Galloway and Weinberg work long hours preparing their defense, which involves weeks of intensive research, discussions, planning and rehearsals. However, on the eve of the trial, Kaffee concludes that We're gonna get creamed!The court-martial begins. During the cross-examination of other Marines from Guantanamo, it is established that Code Reds are standard at the base as a means of getting sloppy recruits to follow procedure, such as taking proper care of accommodation and equipment or completing exercises successfully. Santiago was clearly not up to the standards and yet was not subjected to a Code Red until the evening of his death. Cpl. Jeffrey Barnes (Noah Wyle), who has also been a victim of a Code Red and whom admits he desired to perform one with his comrades on Santiago, claims that Dawson would not have allowed it.In his post-mortem report, the base physician, Dr. Stone (Christopher Guest), stated that Santiago died as a result of poisons on the rag used to gag him. These caused a condition called lactic acidosis which led to his death. However, Kaffee gets Stone to admit that lactic acidosis could also be caused by other symptoms such as heat exhaustion caused by strenuous exercise. Kaffee then produces a report by Stone after a routine examination of Santiago. It indicates that Santiago had respiratory stress and was supposed to be exempted from such exercises for a while. The fact that he was not exempted means that he could have died of heat exhaustion even if the rag was perfectly clean but that Stone had to cover-up his negligence. Kaffee, however, is still unable to get the doctor to admit that he falsified his report of Santiago's death to cover for Jessup and Kendrick. Galloway makes a strong objection that also fails with the judge and she is reprimanded by Weinberg.Kaffee's effectiveness as a litigator strengthens as the trial progresses and he proves to be a tough and clever cross-examiner, impressing even Galloway by the way he handles the proceedings. However, he is under little illusion that his clients are unlikely to be let off. They have never denied assaulting Santiago so the best Kaffee can do is persuade the jury that they did not intend to kill him and that they were acting under orders from Lt. Kendrick.While cross-examining Kendrick, Kaffee confronts him over the fact that he denied Dawson a promotion after the latter helped out a fellow Marine who had been denied food for several days for stealing liquor from the officers' mess. Under oath, Kendrick denies ever ordering Dawson and Downey to inflict a Code Red on Santiago -- he stands by his commanding officer and his duty as a marine despite being rattled by Kaffee's line of questioning. Kaffee also receives reprimands from both the judge and Captain Ross for trying to smear Kendrick's exemplary record as an officer.Lieutenant-Colonel Markinson, Jessup's executive officer, who has gone AWOL since the incident, resurfaces in Kaffee's car half-way through the trial. When Kaffee was in Cuba, Jessup told him that Santiago was due to be transferred off the base for his own safety but Markinson now reveals that that was a lie and that transfer orders were created as part of a cover-up after Santiago's death. Jessup wanted Santiago to stay on the base in order to be trained. He also remarks that though he cannot do anything about Kaffee's appointment to the case, he can at least help him win the case for his clients.A flashback scene shows a meeting between Jessup, Markinson and Kendrick, set on the morning prior to Santiago's death. Jessup was annoyed at the fact that Santiago went above the chain of command when reporting Dawson to the NIS for shooting at the Cuban guard and was not up to doing the tough exercises required at the base. Markinson advocated that Santiago be transferred immediately for safety reasons - the other marines would take revenge for his snitching on Dawson - but Jessup vehemently refused on the grounds that this would set a bad precedent which could weaken their defenses and cost lives. He also makes a grand show of suggesting that transferring Santiago would mean that every other marine on the base would also have to be transferred. He decides that officers have a responsibility to ensure that all personnel are trained appropriately and that Santiago should stay for training. Jessup orders Kendrick to ensure that Santiago show significant improvement on the next evaluation report or he would be held personally responsible. When Markinson objects, Jessup berates and demeans him for questioning his decisions in front of Kendrick, a junior officer, and even implies that Markinson did it out of jealousy for the fact that, although they graduated in the same year and had similar careers, Jessup still outranks him.Back in the present, Markinson also states that Santiago could have left the base in a plane on the evening of his death, rather than the following day as Jessup had claimed. Kaffee is unable to find evidence of the earlier flight in the log book from the Guantanamo airfield. Markinson believes that Jessup has been covering his tracks.Back in court, evidence comes up which questions whether Kendrick ordered Dawson and Downey to carry out the Code Red, something the defense has always taken for granted. It now emerges that Downey was on guard duty and was late reporting back and not in the barracks at the time when Kendrick supposedly gave the order to Dawson. Thus it is the word of Dawson, who had a personal grievance towards Santiago, against that of Kendrick, a highly-decorated, God-fearing officer.Kaffee wants Markinson to testify but rather than publicly dishonor himself and the Marine Corps, Markinson sends a letter to Santiago's parents, blaming his own weakness for the loss of their son, dresses in full dress uniform and commits suicide with his own sidearm.Without Markinson's crucial testimony, Kaffee believes that the case is lost and gets drunk. Galloway tries to convince him to summon Jessup to court and confront him. She believes that Jessup ordered the Code Red and that they have to get him to admit it. There is no evidence for this whatsoever and falsely accusing a superior officer of such a felony could result in Kaffee himself facing a court-martial which will ruin his career. Kaffee loudly and harshly admonishes Galloway for suggesting such a wild plan and she storms out of his apartment. After she leaves, Kaffee reflects on his late father with Weinberg. Weinberg admits that, with the evidence they have, Kaffee's father would never try to blame Jessup, but also says he would rather have the younger Kaffee as lawyer for Dawson and Downey any day, considering the fearless manner with which he questioned Kendrick. Weinberg pushes his friend to consider if it is he or Lionel Kaffee who is handling the case and Daniel Kaffee finally decides to put Jessup on the stand. He finds Galloway walking away in the rain and convinces her to rejoin them when he tells her about calling Jessup in for testimony.At another meeting at Kaffee's house, he tells his partners that they have to rebuild the case against Jessup himself. When Kaffee goes into his closet to find his lucky baseball bat, he's suddenly inspired by his uniforms hanging neatly on the rack. He leaves without a word and begins a new line of research involving phone records. He calls Sam with a new task; Sam has to go to Andrews Air Force base.Jessup is summoned to court. Just as Kaffee is about to start his cross-examination, Weinberg arrives with two Airmen from the Andrews Air Force Base which Jessup does not fail to notice. Kaffee initially gets Jessup to confirm that he had arranged for Santiago to be transferred off the base for his own safety and that the earliest flight was in the morning following his death.Kaffee then questions him over his travel habits. Jessup admits packing sets of clothes, including civilian and military, and various other items. He also admits phoning several friends and relatives in order to meet them while in Washington.Kaffee then points out that Santiago did none of these things. At the time of his death his clothes were unpacked and still hanging in his closet and, after spending months in desperate and vain attempts to get a transfer, he did not contact anyone or make arrangements to be picked up at the airport.Kaffee is hoping to show that the transfer order was phony. However Jessup successfully outsmarts him by saying that he cannot speculate on Santiago's habits and he especially belittles Kaffee for pinning his clients' defense on a phone bill. Kaffee is struck dumb by this setback and Jessup is about to leave with a triumphant smug when the young man demands that he sit back down in the witness chair. Jessup also draws a reprimand from the judge when he slyly criticizes the judge's courtroom procedure.Kaffee now asks if Jessup ordered Kendrick to tell the men not to touch Santiago. Jessup confirms the order and reconfirms that Santiago was to be transferred in case the men attacked him. Kaffee asks if Kendrick or the men may have questioned the order and decided to take matters into their own hands. Jessup angrily rejects this stating that as front-line troops his men have to obey orders at all times without question. At this moment, Kaffee points out that if Jessup's orders are always obeyed then there was no reason to transfer Santiago at all.Momentarily stunned, Jessup tries to come up with alternative explanations for Santiago's transfer which are torpedoed by Kaffee who demands to be told the truth, at which point Jessup explodes: You can't handle the truth!Because he defends his country in a forward area, Colonel Jessup does not see why Kaffee, who has never been on the front line, should even question his methods from under the blanket of the very freedom I provide. Kaffee should either thank him for protecting his country and his way of life or take up a gun and do it himself. Kaffee suddenly begins a tirade of questioning, demanding that Jessup admit he ordered the Code Red. In a fury, Jessup yells that he did.At the prompting of Kaffee and the Judge, prosecutor Ross places Jessup under arrest. Jessup is outraged and lashes out at Kaffee, accusing him of weakening the nation. Kaffee simply expresses satisfaction that Jessup will go to jail for the death of Santiago. He later admits to Ross that the Airmen were brought to court as a bluff to make Jessup believe that the defense had evidence of the earlier flight which he covered-up. Kendrick will also be arrested for ordering the Code Red, committing perjury and participating in the cover-up.Dawson and Downey are found not guilty of murder but are dishonorably discharged for conduct unbecoming a United States Marine. Downey is confused, pointing out that Jessup confirmed that they were obeying orders, but, after getting over the initial shock, Dawson points out that they failed to stand up for those too weak to stand up for themselves, like Santiago. As the two prepare to leave, Kaffee tells Dawson Harold, you don't need to have a patch on your arm to have honor. Dawson, who had previously refused to salute Kaffee, who he saw as a coward, now announces There's an officer on deck! and they exchange salutes."

As he has not made it clear he needs 2 rooms, they are together in the hotel room with one double bed. He begs her to believe he did not do this on purpose. He explains to her about how important it is to get the Summit to agree to a promise they made in the year 2000 in regard to world poverty. Whilst there she implores the Chancellor to do the right thing for the people who are dying in the world every 3 seconds. This, of course, does not go down well with Lawrence's boss.

Her family's resistance to the matter convinces Lucy that a secret lurks behind this mysterious double, and she sets out to find the woman. She slowly finds out that her doppelganger, Genevieve, was an infamous feminist and abortion activist and could be her real grandmother. Why did Genevieve disappear? Why was she scratched from her family's history? Why did she abandon Lucy's mother? Lucy's family stays mum. Her problems pile up when she discovers she's pregnant by her ex-boyfriend. Torn between her mother's advice of an immediate abortion and her ex-boyfriend's proposal, Lucy cannot choose. She finds refuge in the idea that finding Genevieve, who abandoned her own child and was fighting for abortion rights, holds the key to her past, therefore her future as a woman. As her family implodes, Lucy and her abrasive teen sister discover a family plot that leads her to revisit the history of women's liberation in Switzerland through archival footage and encounters with participants in the 1970s movement. Her final confrontation with Genevieve lets out the heavy secret that encumbered her family for three generations of women and forces Lucy to position herself as a feminist.

But learning to navigate and survive in a polar environment wasn't the only obstacle. This team skied the same icy terrain as the rarified community of predominantly white male polar explorers and scientists. At many points in the journey, their place at the table was in question. Representing the nations of Slovenia, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Sweden, Saudi Arabia, France, and the U.K., the team worked through profound differences in language, religion, communication and culture to achieve a singular, common goal. In the end, four team members, including Sheikha Asma Al Thani of Qatar, became the first ever from their nations to ski to the North Pole.Our first stop was the Arctic outpost of Longyearbyen on Norway's Svalbard Archipelago, the northernmost community in the world. There we waited for a Russian team to build Ice Station Barneo - an epic undertaking delayed nearly three weeks in the wake of two recent helicopter crashes that grounded all aviation. When go-time finally came, we flew to Barneo to fuel up, and then in a MI-8 helicopter that dropped us and our sledges, laden with hundreds of pounds of gear, at 2 AM, into -39°F temperatures at roughly 89 degrees North.

Tens of millions starved to death in the years preceding the charismatic leaders brutal and repressive Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and his call to crush the Four Olds. Chaos became rampant as Mao empowered youth to revolution, threatening, humiliating, beating and killing anyone they chose to persecute.Jian was tiny, premature, often sick and unwanted by an already overburdened mother of four. She was left in the care of her grandmother, Nainai, without whom she might surely have died. It wasnt that love was lacking. It was simply unstated, expressions of emotion considered bourgeois, essentially forbidden under Communist rule.
Her parents were devoted to the Party, her mother placing duty to Mao above her own children. Her father, equally staunch in his belief, survived torture at the hands of Japanese invaders when he was young. Suspected of giving secrets to the enemy in exchange for his life while in captivity, he was later exonerated. He gradually distinguished himself, eventually becoming Deputy Governor of the city province of Baicheng.As danger escalated under Mao, neighbors indicted neighbors. Family members informed on one another. No one was safe. Without warning, Jians father was arrested and imprisoned, old suspicions causing him to be publicly humiliated and labeled Big Traitor. Jians mother, a school administrator, was detained and forced to write daily self-recrimination. Strong- willed, she refused to submit to harassment by the Red Guards insisting she denounce and divorce her husband. She would not allow her children to be fatherless.Forced to leave the Government compound, Jians older siblings were sent to the countryside for re-education by peasants. Jian and Nainai were banished to a remote and primitive mud hut to endure harsh conditions and sub-zero temperatures. It was years before the Cultural Revolution came to an end and Mao Zedong died in 1976. For Jian, vivid memories remain of a little girl of eight dodging a barrage of epithets and rocks as she made her way to see her father in prison. She has long held the belief that she must always remain composed, neither showing vulnerability to those who might seek to harm her nor pain to those she loves.As China moved forward, Jian resumed her education. earning an undergraduate degree in English, then immigrating to the United States to attain two masters degrees. She married and bore a baby girl who joined her mother in the States when she was five. As Jian worked hard to provide the trappings of a middle class American life for her daughter Lisa, ironically, a sense of disconnection seeming to build between them. Her eight-year odyssey to write her memoir, Mulberry Child, was born of a need to reveal her past under Mao and share Chinese family roots with Lisa. She was saddened when Lisa showed no interest in the book.When Jian Ping and Lisa returned to China for a bittersweet family visit and the triumphant 2008 Beijing Olympics, Lisa agreed to read the manuscript. Tracing her familys history, she began to see her mother in a different light and accept her own heritage."

Over the years, Pat has learnt how whales see and hear, how they perceive other creatures in the water and how they behave at close quarters. He has a finely tuned sense and knows how to act when within touching distance of a whale - what to do, what not to do and when. This allows him to consistently get closer than anyone else alive - a truly unique skill. Patrick recently experienced a life-changing event. In Dominica in 2019, he had a close encounter with a female sperm whale. She seemed to be curious about him, coming within touching distance, pulsing him with her sonar. She studied him as he studied her. Patrick felt an overwhelming sense that she was genuinely trying to communicate. We will follow Patrick as he travels to Dominica again to find this special whale he named Dolores so she can help him show us the hidden world of her species. Using stunning underwater footage, Patrick will explore the fascinating nature of the sperm whale, attempting to shine a light on its intelligence and complexity, as well as highlighting its current and past relationship with humankind.

While interviewing Privitera and Hedges for Grimonprez's recently released feature length film Shadow World, it became clear that the two men were describing the same anguish but from paradoxical perspectives. One has dedicated his life to unmasking lies and the other has built his life on lies. Making use of both their personal and political histories, Grimonprez gradually reveals the depths of trauma and duplicity, situating the arms trade as a symptom of a profound illness: greed.

Nissim and his brother George, together with Aharon Gabardine, who was the projectionist back in the old days, are determined to fulfill Morris' request. The same day Nissim has his dream, Avram Mandabon, Morris' brother, returns for his brother's memorial after a 25-year absence. His reappearance causes old family feuds to resurface.

Following the advice of Yisrael the Indian, considered the neighborhood authority on films, the brothers decide to screen the Indian-made local hit from years before, Sangam, to which Seniora objects (Nobody cares to watch old Indian movies!) and tries to convince them to screen another movie, but they insist. They eventually find out that the only print of Sangam is in the hands of Avram, their uncle, who refuses to give it to them. And so, as the time for Morris' memorial approaches, as well as the screening date, it seems that a clash is inevitable.

One of the male adults helps the other family members to hide, but with nowhere else in the house to hide he jumps out a window and flees, only to be ridden down by a horsemen, captured and kidnapped to a foreign kingdom. He is dragged before a royal court of monsters (literally and figuratively) consisting of the monstrously fat king and his equally repulsive court, called Hop-Frog because of his now-limping gait, and forced to become the new jester.One morning, the practical joke-obsessed king orders the inventive yet sensitive Hop-Frog to provide entertainment for the arriving Duke and Duchess of Siri-Siril. Following Hop-frog's physical comedy and a sumptuous banquet, the king's guests wheel in a giant bird cage, containing a young dwarfish woman named Tripetta, as a gift for the king. It's love at first sight for Hop-Frog, but his feelings and the condescending and cruel treatment at the hands of the so-called normal courtiers only tortures him even more. Events take an even uglier turn when the king summons Hop-Frog, orders him to come up with a original idea for an upcoming costume ball and forces him to drink goblets of wine (which the poor dwarf can't handle). Trippetta, who has been forced to be present, tries to halt the bullying, but has a goblet of wine thrown in her face for her efforts. This in turn has the effect of immediately sobering Hop-Frog up, and he comes up with a brilliant idea: the king and his councillors will be covered in fur and pretend to be ourangutangs bound together by a lengthy chain and, most appealing to the King's sadistic nature, scare the you-know-what out of everybody. The conceit is a strange one, but the King and his men readily accept it. Later that night, Hop-frog frees Trippetta from her cage to assist him in carrying out his plans for the costume ball.The night of the ball arrives and the plan is carried out; the king and his councillors are sewn into tight-fitting body-suits (which are painted all over with tar and covered with flax) and equipped with carved wooden masks. The illusion is a flawless one, so much so that when the Eight Chained Ourangutangs bust into the party at midnight and create their commotion, none of the guests complain when Hop-Frog lowers a chandelier chain down from the ceiling, hooks it to the chain connecting the beasts and has it and the apes hoisted into the air. Using a torch to pretend to try and find out who these costumed people are, he sets them all afire, with the other partygoers too far out of reach to help. He and Trippetta (who has been waiting on the roof) watch coldly from the roof as the fire claims its victims, then escape into the air on a makeshift flying machine as flames slowly spread through the kingdom."

Their goal: to win the contest and become professional surfers. Thirteen-year-old Fabio and 12-year-old Naama live at Favela do Pavao, an enormous slum near Arpoador Beach, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Pavao is home to Commando Vermelho (CV), or Red Command, one of Rio's most heavily armed drug gangs. It's the Red Command who sets the rules and regulates life in the community. Their presence is ubiquitous, with armed soldiers constantly patrolling the hills and regulating the various points of sale. Fabio lives in an area of the favela called Vietnam, the poorest and most violent part of the slum. When the police come up looking for traffickers, that's where they look - and shoot - first. Raised by illiterate grandparents, he cannot read or write and is not going to school. Fabio is a prime candidate to join CV and become yet another gun-toting teenager involved in Rio's drugs war. In fact, he already shows worrying signs: mouthing off to the police, bullying some of the younger surfers and threatening Naama. Naama lives around the corner from Fabio. Born under a bridge where he lived until he was three, he and his family moved to the favela 9 years ago. What will happen to these best friends? Will any of them win the contest? Will their own relationship survive Fabio's aggressive personality? Can surfing offer a way out for Fabio or will he follow in the footsteps of his dad and join the drug gang?

(In the 1940's his father evacuated with the Nationalist troops to Taiwan after it lost the Mainland to the Communist in the war. It wasn't until 1980's were people allowed to go home to visit in Mainland China). From his search for the earliest memory of life, with a close observation and sensitivity, he exams the parallels of the different lives of a different time. In his previous work, HOW DEEP IS THE OCEAN, director Tang ends it with the ultrasound image of his unborn child, representing the beginning of a new life. With this work, HOW HIGH IS THE MOUNTAIN, it is rather a beginning of a series of questions about life and a continuation of examination of his own life and the longing of a perfect world.

Simpson case- but few know this same kind of trouble can affect teen relationships. It Ain't Love follows the young, spirited members of FACES, a gutsy improv theater company, combining acting and therapy, known for telling it like it is. Given three months to create a show about abusive relationships, the kids, aged 15-24, start by boldly exploring their own love lives. Intense reenactments bring the violence they've experienced and inflicted dramatically to life. Brian acts out a night when he punched his girlfriend in the face and then blamed it on being drunk. When Amares' boyfriend chokes her, it brings back memories of her father battering her mother. Nearly everyone has had some sort of an abusive relationship, and now the guys who abused and the girls who have been abused are forced to reckon with each other, sometimes very loudly. The process is both exhilarating and painful but the members of FACES grow in their understanding of abuse and, in the end, their new show is triumphant.

A radioactive matter. 33 years after the disaster.5 days and nights illegally in the restricted area, in Pripyat and on the Duga-1 antenna.The restricted area from a completely different point of view. No cellphone connection, no help from outside, all on your own.
Together with STALKER we move illegally into the zone of alienation, also called the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.
Partly the children of former liquidators of the nuclear accident.
At the first night we are stuck between different rivers and the marshes at some point and have to turn around. But then there is a way.
We walk at night, stay in abandoned villages until we reach Pripyat.
A formerly over 40000 inhabitants large city lies before us, uninhabited.
A beauty spreads before us. But this beauty hurts too.And you do not feel alone all the time. Are these just the ghosts of yesteryear or is there more?We also climb onto the largest still existing, former listening antenna. Called Woodpecker and can we sleep up there at 140 meters above the ground?
5 days after which the feet ache, the shoulders do not want to carry the backpack anymore. But the impressions are stronger than any pain.5 days and nights that are not only physically hard, but also changed something in our soul and heart.
A journey that becomes more than just the illegal entry into the death zone!"
