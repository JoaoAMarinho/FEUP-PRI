Diego, Alvaro, Lorenzo and Julio all share the same town, an other-worldly and enigmatic city that protects them for days on end. Troubadours is a reflection on art and fame, unafraid of reaching into its insanity. It finds the adequate rhythm to portray the drives of different persons who have left everything behind them, and now keep forging ahead irrevocably. The magic to be found a gaze, the concealed beauty of an ordinary town or the sheer greatness of the insignificant are the overarching notions and ideas of this film.

While Jacob is optimistic about the life ahead, his wife Monica is disappointed and worries about their son David's heart condition; due to this he is frequently told not to run. Jacob and Monica work sexing chicks at the nearby hatchery and argue constantly while David and his sister Anne eavesdrop.To help watch the children during the day, they arrange for Monica's mother Soon-ja to travel from South Korea. David, who is forced to share a room with her, avoids her because she does not conform to his idea of how a grandmother should be. Still, Soon-ja attempts to adjust to life in the States and bond with the children.The well that Jacob dug runs dry. Jacob is reluctant to pay for county water, but eventually is forced to do so. He runs into additional difficulties, such as the vendor in Dallas canceling their order at the last minute. Even so, he perseveres despite Monica's vocal desire to return to California. This strains their marriage closer to breaking point.Meanwhile, Soon-ja takes the children to plant minari seeds by the creek. She tells them how resilient and useful the plant is, and predicts plentiful growth. David finally begins to warm to his grandmother after she teaches him card games, bandages his wounds, and soothes him to sleep. Soon-ja also encourages him to do more physical activity, something his parents discourage, saying that he is stronger than they think.Soon-ja suddenly suffers a stroke overnight.

Following an emotional argument, the two tacitly agree to separate.However, Soon-ja accidentally sets the barn containing the produce on fire in their absence. Upon arriving home, Jacob rushes in to save the crops, and Monica soon follows. Eventually, the fire grows out of control, and they decide to save each other while leaving the barn to burn.

After her husband (played by Priyanshu Chatterjee) Dibakar's tragic demise, Esha and Chandrima had none but each other. However, being the strong and independent woman that she has always been, Chandrima raised her daughter all by herself. Never did she let the absence of a 'male parent' affect their bonding, or so does she think. Time flies by and, as Esha grows into adulthood, distance starts to grow between the duo. It is only after a pregnant Esha's suicide-attempt that Chandrima realizes how little she knows about her daughter's life outside the house. Especially since college days, Esha got carried away in the newfound freedom. Whereas, Chandrima busy in her professional life, has failed to keep track of this change. Eventually, they had become, as Chandrima comes to admit, strangers under the same roof. Thereafter, Chandrima starts to introspect Esha's perspective and, in the process, discovers a side of her daughter she never knew. What follows is how she, with all the strength of her love, brings Esha back to a normal life. Esha too, comes to realize that Chandrima was always her closest friend; had been there for her and always will be. Through this heartwarming story, Colours of life reflects on our lives in the contemporary world where we, always engaged in mechanical communication, are perhaps.

At the age of ten, she accidentally found the Clow Book, containing the magical Clow Cards created by Clow Reed, and was tasked to capture them after releasing them from the book. Sakura succeeds in capturing the cards and became their master after recognition by their guardians Keroberos and Yue. In a second task, Sakura had to use her own magic to transform the cards in Sakura Cards or they would cease being magical, whilst challenged by Clow Reeds reincarnation Eriol Hiiragizawa. Sakura successfully transforms all the cards and becomes their true mistress. The series, which the film is a continuation of, ended with Sakuras rival-turned-friend Syaoran Li confessing his love to her before leaving for Hong Kong. Sakura remained unsure of how to respond, but her affection for Syaoran led to the creation of a brand new Clow Card, appearing as a winged heart but lacked a name.The film opens in the demolished remains of the house owned by Clow Reed/Eriol, but the site begins to tremor. A chair is launched up into the air and crashes back down, revealing a hole beneath where a glowing, unsealed Clow Card lies in darkness. The film cuts to night at Penguin Park in Tomoeda, Japan, where Sakura is practicing her magic against monsters created through the power of the Create Card, and is aided by Keroberos and Yue. The fight ends, and is revealed to be part of a video recording directed by Sakuras best friend and cousin Tomoyo Daidoji. Sakura, Tomoyo and Kero (the smaller form of Keroberos) watch the video in Sakuras bedroom. While Tomoyo and Kero celebrate the film, Sakura is embarrassed by it. Tomoyo skims through the Clow Cards, trying to decide which ones to use in the next video, with Kero objecting to the use of the Change Card, reminding him of its body swapping magic which caused trouble for him and Syaoran.The mention of Syaoran causes Sakura to blush, realising she did love Syaoran when she created the unnamed Clow Card. Syaorans voice catches her attention, revealing there is unrecorded footage still on the video of Sakura and Syaoran battling the Bubble Card. Sakura admits to Tomoyo that she does love Syaoran, and intends on telling him face-to-face like he did, gaining Tomoyos support. The next day, Sakura prepares to go to school, even though it is the summer, mainly because her class is performing a play as part of Tomoedas annual Nadeshiko Festival. After being teased by her big brother Toya, Sakura rollerskates to school, but ends up late for the rehearsal, where she is to play the role of a princess opposite Takashi Yamazaki who is playing the prince. The play was written by Naoko Yanagisawa. After school, Sakura and Tomoyo pass by where Eriols house was, now replaced with an amusement park, which will open soon. That night, Sakura rehearses a part of the play at home, but the words remind her of what she will have to say to Syaoran. At the amusement park, the unsealed card materialises above the parks clock tower, taking on the form of a young girl sporting wings. This is the Nothing Card.Sakura and Tomoyo visit the park, but Sakura senses the Clow Cards aura and runs into the park to find. She rounds a corner and collides with someone, who grabs her hand. Sakura apologises but is shocked when her saviour is noneother than Syaoran. Syaorans cousin Meiling runs around the corner, surprising Sakura even more. At Penguin Park, Sakura catches up Meiling who nearly lets slip that she and Tomoyo planned this reunion. Meiling whispers to Sakura that her engagement to Syaoran has ended, following a promise they made that they would end it if Syaoran found someone else who he loved more, namely Sakura. Syaoran asks Tomoyo if she was the one who invited them to Tomoeda, which Tomoyo admits to. She asks him if he wanted to see Sakura again, but he worries that his presence will now force an answer from Sakura. Meiling explains she is staying at Tomoyos mansion during their stay and has to decline Sakuras invitation to dinner since she is going to be busy with Tomoyo, but asks Sakura to treat Syaoran instead, much to Sakura and Syaorans surprise.After Tomoyo and Meiling deliberately make excuses to leave, Sakura takes Syaoran home though the atmosphere between them is awkward, until Sakura attempts to pluck up the courage to confess to Syaoran, only for her attempt to be crashed by Keros sudden appearance when he smells cake. Sakura dashes off to make dinner, leaving Syaoran and Kero to argue to the point that Kero transforms into Keroberos and pins Syaoran to the sofa, mocking him. After dinner, Syaoran and Kero nearly argue again, but Sakura scolds Kero. Sakura takes a second opportunity to confess to Syaoran, only for Toya and his best friend Yukito Tsukishiro, the human form of Yue, enter, with Toya raging upon seeing Syaoran. Syaoran leaves for the night, with Sakura seeing him off, promising to see each other at school tomorrow. Inside, Toya and Yukito have dinner, but Toya is moody because Syaoran returned. Upstairs in Sakuras bedroom, the Clow Cards glow, and the Change Card is stolen by the Nothing Card, unnoticed by Sakura and Kero.Syaoran and Meiling arrive at school where they reunite with their friends. Meiling goes to Tomoyo, expressing her disappointment that Sakura did not confess, but Tomoyo is pleased, hoping to be able to record Sakuras confession on her trusty video camera. Sakura arrives late again, and shyly says good morning to Syaoran. After school, Sakura and her friends walk through the park, with Meiling none-too-subtly to Sakura that she should pick the right time to confess to Syaoran, though Sakura remains dense to Meilings implications. The group go to buy some juice, but Sakura becomes puzzled by its location, previously using a now-absent mailbox to remember the right street. The group leave, failing to noticing the remains of the mailbox, as if it has been erased from existence.That night, Sakura writes a letter to Eriol, who left Tomoeda four months ago back to England with his friends Kaho Mizuki, Spinel Sun and Ruby Moon. Kero also wrote a letter for Spinel, his rival, after completing a video game that day. Sakura falls asleep, as another Clow Card is stolen by the Nothing. A montage follows in school as the class rehearses for the play, with Sakura and Syaoran spending most of the time staring at each other from afar. Sakura catches Syaoran out in the hall and tries to confess, only for it to be stopped when an army of students run by. Tomoyo presents the plays costumes to Sakura and Yamizaki, Sakura wearing a beautiful pink gown, and ends up sharing a far off look with Syaoran.That afternoon, Sakura and Syaoran are deliberately left alone together by Tomoyo and Meiling, only for Sakuras fourth attempt at a confession is interrupted by Toya dressed in a rabbit costume, promoting the festival. Yukito scolds Toya and forces him to buy ice cream for Sakura and the others. Sakura and Yukito sit together, with Yukito, who was Sakuras former crush, asking if she has confessed to her true love. Sakura admits she hasnt but will do her best, Yue giving her his support and that of Yue. Another Clow Card is stolen from Sakuras bag, but this time, Sakura senses the cards disappearance and checks her bag. In the park, Sakura tell Syaoran she felt an aura but assumes it was just her imagination. The group discovers a bridge in the park has disappeared. Sakura informs Kero of the missing bridge, but while waving it off, he tells Sakura to keep her cards on hand. Sakura receives a phone call from Meiling, inviting her to the amusement park tomorrow.The next day, Sakura is late for the meet up at the amusement park, with Tomoyo and Meiling vowing to get Sakura to confess at the park. In a montage, the group are shown enjoying the day, until Meiling decides to go onto the ferris wheel. Since it is only two people per carriage, Meiling and Tomoyo decide to share one, forcing Sakura and Syaoran to go together. On the ferris wheel, Tomoyo films the carriage that Sakura and Syaoran are in, who sit in their own in uncomfortable silence. Sakura takes the opportunity to tell Syaoran without interference, only for another Clow Card to be stolen. Sakura and Syaoran both spot it and pursue the card as soon as they can exit the ferris wheel.Sensing the aura Sakura felt on the day Syaoran returned, they follow it to the parks funhouse and realise there is a new Clow Card in the attraction. Sakura and Syaoran spot the Nothing Card watching them through a mirror and confront her. Sakura goes to use the Through Card and discovers it has gone missing. Before Sakuras eyes, the Nothing steals three more cards, asking that she return her friends. Sakura summons the Wood Card, but the Nothing steals the card as well before disappearing. Sakura informs Kero of what happened, but is interrupted by a phone call from Eriol, who is aware of what is happening.Eriol explains that the Nothing was created and sealed away by Clow Reed, and acts as a negative counterbalance to the combined powers of the fifty-two original Clow Cards. Now that all of the cards became Sakura Cards, the Nothings seal has been broken and she is stealing the cards to reclaim the balance between the cards creative powers and her own destructive powers. Eriol asks if part of the city have disappeared, causing Sakura to remember the missing mailbox and bridge. Eriol explains the Nothing will continue erasing things, even people, until she regains all of the cards. Eriol tells Sakura that she must seal and transform the Nothing into a Sakura Card, but it will come at a price, namely the love Sakura has for the person she holds most dear. Eriols phone line, which has been protected by an incantation all this time, is destroyed by the Nothing, ending Sakura and Eriols call. Eriol turns to his friends including Kaho Mizuki, who asks if he knows the outcome of the situation, but Eriol does not.The next day, the class finish a full rehearsal of the play, with their teacher Mr. Terada rallying everyone for the festival tomorrow. Sakura and Syaoran go outside where it is raining and Sakura explains everything Eriol told her to Syaoran. Sakura recalls that she was briefly trapped in a world without love when she faced the Final Judgement after capturing the Clow Cards, and admits she never wants to see something like that happen again. With no apparent way around it, Syaoran seemingly admits defeat. Sakura asks why he would throw away his love so easily, but Syaoran claims he would rather give up his feelings than see the whole city be destroyed. Hurt by these comments, Sakura runs out into the rain until she meets Yukito. When Sakura is unable to explain what is wrong, Yukito transform into Yue to make it easier for her and learns of the situation and gives Sakura a boost of confidence.The day of the Nadeshiko Festival arrives, but Sakura is upset by her situation. Tomoyo, Meiling and Kero are present, with Syaoran standing outside the door. The Nothing appears, stealing another card and leaving a large hole in the middle of the schools running track. Sakura uses the Sleep Card to knock everyone save herself and her friends out, but the Nothing steals Sleep before vanishing. The others wake up, but Yamazaki has hurt his arm, leaving him unfit to participate in the play. Mr. Terada suggests cancelling the play, but Yamazaki objects, telling everyone that Syaoran is a worthy replacement. That night, Tomoyo performs onstage at an amphitheatre before the townsfolk of Tomoeda, while both Sakura and Syaoran are worrying about both performing and the Nothing Card. Tomoyo ends her song and joins Sakura and Kero in a dressing room, telling her friends that every day should be lived well so that there are no regrets.At the amphitheatre, Sakuras father Fujitaka ends up sitting beside Tomoyos mother Sonomi, who he and his late wife Nadeshiko are related too. As the play begins, Sonomi has her bodyguards prepare large video equipment to record it. Sakura enters on stage with her friends including Meiling, Sakura playing a princess at a masquerade ball. The plays setting involves two nations battling for a magic stone, but the ball is to uphold peace. Sakura comments she is not a good dancer, but Meiling encourages her to take centre stage and look for a good dancer who will help her. Sakura admits she hates war, prompting Syaoran as a prince to step up and reveal his similar opinions. Syaoran invites Sakura to dance, though admitting he is not very good at it. The two dance onstage, with Kero, Tomoyo, Meiling and an angry Toya watching.The play continues, where Syaoran and Sakura are now alone, with Syaoran admitting he is a prince from the warring neighbouring country. Syaoran then confesses his love to Sakura, who is unable to accept her own love for the prince. Most of the onlookers are in tears at this point. Sakura tells Syaoran to erase his feelings of her from his heart and goes to leave in tears, only for the lighting to suddenly explode and the whole city shakes. Realising the Nothing is near, Sakura witnesses most of the Clow Cards being stolen by the Nothing all at once. Huge black orbs spread across the city, erasing great chunks of it, and the audience, Sakuras friends, Fujitaka, Sonomi and Toya are all caught in the Nothings power and disappear. Kero and Yukito transform into Keroberos and Yue, joining Sakura, Syaoran, Tomoyo and Meiling. Sakura decides she must seal the Nothing, and Syaoran agrees to go with her.Tomoyo chimes in, revealing she has made battle costumes for Sakura and Syaoran for the upcoming battle, believing Sakura will return from the fight with a smile. On a rooftop, the group observe the destruction caused by the Nothing. Sakura and Syaoran wear their new battle costumes, Sakura wearing a pink outfit with long gloves, and Syaoran wears a similar green-coloured outfit. The Nothing steals more cards, but Sakura tries using the Windy Card to divert the cards back to her, only for them all to be caught by the Nothing. The whole building shakes, and Sakura spots Tomoyo and Meiling being caught in one of the black orbs. Sakura races to save them, but Syaoran grabs her at the last moment, but their friends disappear. Keroberos and Yue realise the Nothing is hiding out at the amusement park, so the four fly to find her.The group land at the park and are immediately set upon by enchanted parts of the park. The Nothing tosses a Viking ship at Sakura, but she evades it by using the Jump Card, which allows her to jump great heights and distances. She leaps up to the rollercoaster but sees the Nothing moving a rollercoaster cart slowly down a hill before she steals the Jump. Sakura flees from the rollercoaster and uses the Time Card to freeze time. The Nothing begins to weaken Times power and steals it. Sakura falls from the rollercoaster but is saved by Keroberos. Yue leaps into battle and tries to shoot the Nothing with an arrow, only for it to be deflected by the Nothings shield, and Yue is consumed by her power. Keroberos follows, launching a blast of fire at her, and tries to strike her from the air, only to be consumed by the Nothings power too.Syaoran concludes the Nothing can erase the magic made by Clow Reed. Sakura panics, asking what they should do, but turns and finds Syaoran has vanished. Syaoran chases the Nothing who has fled to the ferris wheel. Syaoran leaps onto it to confront her and fires a lightning-based attack at her from his sword, hoping it will convince her to become a card. Sakura runs over, as the Nothing activates its power, obliterating the ferris wheel and taking Syaoran with it. Sakura uses the Fly Card, sprouting wings, and flies to try to save Syaoran, but fails. Realising everyone she loves is gone, Sakura cries and pursues the Nothing as she flies back to the clock tower.Sakura flies up to confront the Nothing, but she steals the Fly Card, causing Sakura to fall down the tower. She grabs onto the clock towers giant pendulum and uses the Shield Card to defend herself when the Nothing breaks the pendulum in two. The pendulum drops to the ground, but Sakura makes it to a staircase spiralling the tower. Syaoran is revealed to have survived the Nothings power and crouches at the bottom of the tower. The Nothing confronts Sakura, glad that she has collected all of her friends. Sakura threatens to seal the Nothing, but she objects, trying to swallow with her powers. Trapped on a ledge, Sakura is approached by the Nothing who asks her why she is trying to take her friends from her, lamenting that she was imprisoned in darkness for so long. Sakura shouts at the Nothing, telling her stealing the cards is no way to make friends. The Clow Cards all escape the Nothing, who asks if they hate her. When the cards return to Sakuras side, she collapses and bursts into tears.The Clow Cards form a bridge for Sakura to walk to the Nothing. Sakura walks over to the Nothing, telling her that everything will be alright, and invites her to join her fellow cards out of friendship. The Nothing silently accepts, so Sakura uses her Clow Staff to seal the Nothing, lamenting she was unable to tell Syaoran how she felt. However, as the Nothing turns into a card, her powers suddenly surround Syaoran instead of Sakura. Syaoran realises he was chosen instead of her because he had more magic left, but promises Sakura even if his feelings for her are erased, he will fall in love with her all over again. Syaoran is consumed by the Nothings power, causing Sakura to cry. However, the nameless card she has flies out and intercepts the Nothings magic.Sakura sobs to herself that Syaorans love is gone, only for the nameless card to float down to her, revealed to her fused with the Nothing, and has gained a name The Hope Card. Sakura notices Syaoran looking at her, so she takes the opportunity to confess to him at long last. Syaoran does not react, causing Sakura to start crying again. However, Syaoran suddenly speaks, revealing he too shares her feelings, and his memory of her was not erased after all, thanks to the nameless card intervening with the Nothings powers. Sakura cries tears of joy as the sun rises over Tomoeda and the Nothings destruction is reversed. Outside, Tomoyo, Meiling, Fujitaka, Sonomi, Toya, Kero and Yukito awaken and find the world is back to normal, though Yukito catches Kero moving about.In the clock tower, Sakura activates the Jump Card, intending to jump through the hole in the tower to reach Syaoran. Syaoran objects, telling her to wait until the floor reappears. Impatient and ready to hug him, Sakura takes a running jump and springs across the hole to reach Syaoran, proclaiming that she loves him, as the credits roll. A promotional still that came with the DVD revealed that Sakura reached Syaoran, and landed in his arms."

Worse, the modern stereotype America has about Native Americans is limited to the oppressed drunkard or the fat casino cat, neither of which deserves understanding nor empathy. No matter what kind of image is evoked, you cant win if youre Native: A successful Indian exploits the American way by not giving back his fair share and a downtrodden Indian cant pull himself up by his boot straps no matter how much government assistance hes given. Native Americans are blamed for not taking responsibility for the plight of their people and told that they dont deserve help or money despite the fact that Native Americans have the highest poverty rates and the lowest access to health care of any race in the United States. But when we look beneath the stereotypes and understand the issues and statistics of whats really happening in Indian Country, the truth is surprising, complex, and frustrating. There are spiritual, psychological, and physical wounds experienced in large numbers of the Native American population and these hurts have a name, Historical Trauma. The theory of Historical Trauma stemmed from research done by Dr. Maria Yellowhorse Braveheart in her own community during the 1980s. Dodging Bullets, confronts Historical Trauma head-on through interviews and discussions with young Native Americans whose lives are stricken by plights known to be effects of Historical Trauma. The film explores research professionals whose work helps develop a better understanding of Trauma, how it relates to Native Americans specifically and provides insight into ways we can improve the outcomes of Native people dealing with these challenges. The individuals shown in the film come from a variety of social and economic backgrounds: for example, a middle-school student living on the poverty stricken Blackfeet Indian Reservation battling an addiction to meth, a hardened enforcer of the A.I.M., who has leaned the importance of love late in life to a successful author/professor teaching the Ojibwe language to university students."

However, Naval investigator and lawyer Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway (Demi Moore) suspects that Dawson and Downey, who were otherwise exemplary marines, were carrying out a Code Red, an unofficial act of discipline in which soldiers are submitted to methods akin to bullying in order to get them to improve their performance, toe the line or follow procedure. Santiago compared unfavorably to his fellow Marines, being clumsy and lagging behind on exercises and was socially ostracized. He denounced Dawson in an attempt to be transferred away from Guantanamo.Dawson and Downey are taken to a military prison in Washington D.C. to await trial. Galloway requests to defend them but the case is given to Lieutenant Junior Grade Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise), a U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps lawyer who is inexperienced in courtroom litigation, but has a reputation for arranging plea bargains, which gives him time to devote himself to his passion for softball. It is indicated that he has a psychological fear about having to match up to his late father, Lionel Kaffee, a leading attorney, who is regarded as one of the great trial lawyers of recent times. Galloway manages to get herself appointed as Downey's lawyer, thus playing a part in the proceedings. The third member of the defense team is Kaffee's friend Lt. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak), who is a top legal researcher.Kaffee meets with the defendants and finds that they are of the strictest type of Marines - those that serve in a forward area (on the line between their country and an enemy country) and are required to take their duties very seriously. Dawson is tough and authoritative and believes in honor and duty. Downey, a simple-minded young man and an archetypal village idiot, is guided solely by his devotion to being a Marine and his dedication to his superior, namely Dawson.Kaffee, Weinberg and Galloway fly to Guantanamo Bay to examine the crime scene and to meet with the base commander, Col. Nathan R. Jessup (Jack Nicholson), his executive officer, Lt. Col. Matthew Markinson (J.T. Walsh) and Santiago's commanding officer, Lt. Jonathan Kendrick (Kiefer Sutherland). Pressed by Galloway, Jessup denies that Code Reds, which are against military guidelines, are practiced but makes little secret of the fact that he sees them as a good way of enforcing discipline, especially on the front line. Jessup also tells them that he arranged for Santiago to leave the base for his own safety once his denunciation of Dawson became known but that he died before he could leave. At one point, Kaffee casually (and with regard for military decorum) asks Jessup for a copy of Santiago's transfer order. Jessup says he'll comply but also hostilely demands that Kaffee ask with the proper acknowledgment of Jessup's rank as a colonel. Kaffee is cowed into complying and Jessup happily agrees.When the defense team returns to Washington D.C., they learn that Markinson has gone AWOL and is unlikely to be found since he is a veteran intelligence operative who can cover his tracks.Hours before Santiago's death, Kendrick assembled the platoon and told them that they were not to touch him. However Dawson and Downey now tell Kaffee and Galloway that Kendrick subsequently met with them again and ordered a Code Red on Santiago. They never intended to kill him, just to shave his head in order to teach him a lesson, but he died as a result of a rag being shoved into his mouth as a gag.The prosecution is led by Marine Captain Jack Ross (Kevin Bacon) who is a friend of Kaffee's. Ross makes no secret of the fact that he has been given a lot of leeway by his superiors to close the case since Colonel Jessup is expected to take up an important post with the National Security Council (NSC) and this could be put in jeopardy due to the Santiago affair. In fact, Kaffee may have been appointed specifically because of his reputation for plea-bargains and the hope that the case would never make it to court. Ross offers a deal which will see Dawson and Downey serving just six months in prison. When Kaffee puts this to the defendants, however, Dawson regards such a move as cowardly and dishonorable and rejects it, knowing that he and Downey will be dishonorably discharged from the corps. He believes that he was doing his job and obeying orders and wants to make this point in court even if he and Downey end up serving a life sentence. Seeing Kaffee as nothing more than a coward for making the deal and trying to avoid fighting the case, Dawson refuses to salute him when he leaves the room.Failing to understand Dawson's stubbornness, Kaffee at first decides to resign from the case, but after thinking things through he agrees to go ahead. At the grand jury hearing, he enters a plea of not guilty for his defendants. He, Galloway and Weinberg work long hours preparing their defense, which involves weeks of intensive research, discussions, planning and rehearsals. However, on the eve of the trial, Kaffee concludes that We're gonna get creamed!The court-martial begins. During the cross-examination of other Marines from Guantanamo, it is established that Code Reds are standard at the base as a means of getting sloppy recruits to follow procedure, such as taking proper care of accommodation and equipment or completing exercises successfully. Santiago was clearly not up to the standards and yet was not subjected to a Code Red until the evening of his death. Cpl. Jeffrey Barnes (Noah Wyle), who has also been a victim of a Code Red and whom admits he desired to perform one with his comrades on Santiago, claims that Dawson would not have allowed it.In his post-mortem report, the base physician, Dr. Stone (Christopher Guest), stated that Santiago died as a result of poisons on the rag used to gag him. These caused a condition called lactic acidosis which led to his death. However, Kaffee gets Stone to admit that lactic acidosis could also be caused by other symptoms such as heat exhaustion caused by strenuous exercise. Kaffee then produces a report by Stone after a routine examination of Santiago. It indicates that Santiago had respiratory stress and was supposed to be exempted from such exercises for a while. The fact that he was not exempted means that he could have died of heat exhaustion even if the rag was perfectly clean but that Stone had to cover-up his negligence. Kaffee, however, is still unable to get the doctor to admit that he falsified his report of Santiago's death to cover for Jessup and Kendrick. Galloway makes a strong objection that also fails with the judge and she is reprimanded by Weinberg.Kaffee's effectiveness as a litigator strengthens as the trial progresses and he proves to be a tough and clever cross-examiner, impressing even Galloway by the way he handles the proceedings. However, he is under little illusion that his clients are unlikely to be let off. They have never denied assaulting Santiago so the best Kaffee can do is persuade the jury that they did not intend to kill him and that they were acting under orders from Lt. Kendrick.While cross-examining Kendrick, Kaffee confronts him over the fact that he denied Dawson a promotion after the latter helped out a fellow Marine who had been denied food for several days for stealing liquor from the officers' mess. Under oath, Kendrick denies ever ordering Dawson and Downey to inflict a Code Red on Santiago -- he stands by his commanding officer and his duty as a marine despite being rattled by Kaffee's line of questioning. Kaffee also receives reprimands from both the judge and Captain Ross for trying to smear Kendrick's exemplary record as an officer.Lieutenant-Colonel Markinson, Jessup's executive officer, who has gone AWOL since the incident, resurfaces in Kaffee's car half-way through the trial. When Kaffee was in Cuba, Jessup told him that Santiago was due to be transferred off the base for his own safety but Markinson now reveals that that was a lie and that transfer orders were created as part of a cover-up after Santiago's death. Jessup wanted Santiago to stay on the base in order to be trained. He also remarks that though he cannot do anything about Kaffee's appointment to the case, he can at least help him win the case for his clients.A flashback scene shows a meeting between Jessup, Markinson and Kendrick, set on the morning prior to Santiago's death. Jessup was annoyed at the fact that Santiago went above the chain of command when reporting Dawson to the NIS for shooting at the Cuban guard and was not up to doing the tough exercises required at the base. Markinson advocated that Santiago be transferred immediately for safety reasons - the other marines would take revenge for his snitching on Dawson - but Jessup vehemently refused on the grounds that this would set a bad precedent which could weaken their defenses and cost lives. He also makes a grand show of suggesting that transferring Santiago would mean that every other marine on the base would also have to be transferred. He decides that officers have a responsibility to ensure that all personnel are trained appropriately and that Santiago should stay for training. Jessup orders Kendrick to ensure that Santiago show significant improvement on the next evaluation report or he would be held personally responsible. When Markinson objects, Jessup berates and demeans him for questioning his decisions in front of Kendrick, a junior officer, and even implies that Markinson did it out of jealousy for the fact that, although they graduated in the same year and had similar careers, Jessup still outranks him.Back in the present, Markinson also states that Santiago could have left the base in a plane on the evening of his death, rather than the following day as Jessup had claimed. Kaffee is unable to find evidence of the earlier flight in the log book from the Guantanamo airfield. Markinson believes that Jessup has been covering his tracks.Back in court, evidence comes up which questions whether Kendrick ordered Dawson and Downey to carry out the Code Red, something the defense has always taken for granted. It now emerges that Downey was on guard duty and was late reporting back and not in the barracks at the time when Kendrick supposedly gave the order to Dawson. Thus it is the word of Dawson, who had a personal grievance towards Santiago, against that of Kendrick, a highly-decorated, God-fearing officer.Kaffee wants Markinson to testify but rather than publicly dishonor himself and the Marine Corps, Markinson sends a letter to Santiago's parents, blaming his own weakness for the loss of their son, dresses in full dress uniform and commits suicide with his own sidearm.Without Markinson's crucial testimony, Kaffee believes that the case is lost and gets drunk. Galloway tries to convince him to summon Jessup to court and confront him. She believes that Jessup ordered the Code Red and that they have to get him to admit it. There is no evidence for this whatsoever and falsely accusing a superior officer of such a felony could result in Kaffee himself facing a court-martial which will ruin his career. Kaffee loudly and harshly admonishes Galloway for suggesting such a wild plan and she storms out of his apartment. After she leaves, Kaffee reflects on his late father with Weinberg. Weinberg admits that, with the evidence they have, Kaffee's father would never try to blame Jessup, but also says he would rather have the younger Kaffee as lawyer for Dawson and Downey any day, considering the fearless manner with which he questioned Kendrick. Weinberg pushes his friend to consider if it is he or Lionel Kaffee who is handling the case and Daniel Kaffee finally decides to put Jessup on the stand. He finds Galloway walking away in the rain and convinces her to rejoin them when he tells her about calling Jessup in for testimony.At another meeting at Kaffee's house, he tells his partners that they have to rebuild the case against Jessup himself. When Kaffee goes into his closet to find his lucky baseball bat, he's suddenly inspired by his uniforms hanging neatly on the rack. He leaves without a word and begins a new line of research involving phone records. He calls Sam with a new task; Sam has to go to Andrews Air Force base.Jessup is summoned to court. Just as Kaffee is about to start his cross-examination, Weinberg arrives with two Airmen from the Andrews Air Force Base which Jessup does not fail to notice. Kaffee initially gets Jessup to confirm that he had arranged for Santiago to be transferred off the base for his own safety and that the earliest flight was in the morning following his death.Kaffee then questions him over his travel habits. Jessup admits packing sets of clothes, including civilian and military, and various other items. He also admits phoning several friends and relatives in order to meet them while in Washington.Kaffee then points out that Santiago did none of these things. At the time of his death his clothes were unpacked and still hanging in his closet and, after spending months in desperate and vain attempts to get a transfer, he did not contact anyone or make arrangements to be picked up at the airport.Kaffee is hoping to show that the transfer order was phony. However Jessup successfully outsmarts him by saying that he cannot speculate on Santiago's habits and he especially belittles Kaffee for pinning his clients' defense on a phone bill. Kaffee is struck dumb by this setback and Jessup is about to leave with a triumphant smug when the young man demands that he sit back down in the witness chair. Jessup also draws a reprimand from the judge when he slyly criticizes the judge's courtroom procedure.Kaffee now asks if Jessup ordered Kendrick to tell the men not to touch Santiago. Jessup confirms the order and reconfirms that Santiago was to be transferred in case the men attacked him. Kaffee asks if Kendrick or the men may have questioned the order and decided to take matters into their own hands. Jessup angrily rejects this stating that as front-line troops his men have to obey orders at all times without question. At this moment, Kaffee points out that if Jessup's orders are always obeyed then there was no reason to transfer Santiago at all.Momentarily stunned, Jessup tries to come up with alternative explanations for Santiago's transfer which are torpedoed by Kaffee who demands to be told the truth, at which point Jessup explodes: You can't handle the truth!Because he defends his country in a forward area, Colonel Jessup does not see why Kaffee, who has never been on the front line, should even question his methods from under the blanket of the very freedom I provide. Kaffee should either thank him for protecting his country and his way of life or take up a gun and do it himself. Kaffee suddenly begins a tirade of questioning, demanding that Jessup admit he ordered the Code Red. In a fury, Jessup yells that he did.At the prompting of Kaffee and the Judge, prosecutor Ross places Jessup under arrest. Jessup is outraged and lashes out at Kaffee, accusing him of weakening the nation. Kaffee simply expresses satisfaction that Jessup will go to jail for the death of Santiago. He later admits to Ross that the Airmen were brought to court as a bluff to make Jessup believe that the defense had evidence of the earlier flight which he covered-up. Kendrick will also be arrested for ordering the Code Red, committing perjury and participating in the cover-up.Dawson and Downey are found not guilty of murder but are dishonorably discharged for conduct unbecoming a United States Marine. Downey is confused, pointing out that Jessup confirmed that they were obeying orders, but, after getting over the initial shock, Dawson points out that they failed to stand up for those too weak to stand up for themselves, like Santiago. As the two prepare to leave, Kaffee tells Dawson Harold, you don't need to have a patch on your arm to have honor. Dawson, who had previously refused to salute Kaffee, who he saw as a coward, now announces There's an officer on deck! and they exchange salutes."

A couple both as shy as each other meet in a cafe. There are no other tables and so Lawrence, a timid, dedicated civil servant finds himself sitting not quite opposite Gina, a quiet, beautiful young girl. They begin to talk haltingly to each other. She is a mystery but stirs something in Lawrence for the fist time in a long time. In a stumbling attempt Lawrence asks Gina out for dinner. To his surprise she agrees .He works for the Chancellor of the Exchequer and has to go to Iceland for the G8 Summit. The year is 2005. He asks her to go with him. She says yes. As he has not made it clear he needs 2 rooms, they are together in the hotel room with one double bed. He begs her to believe he did not do this on purpose. He explains to her about how important it is to get the Summit to agree to a promise they made in the year 2000 in regard to world poverty. Whilst there she implores the Chancellor to do the right thing for the people who are dying in the world every 3 seconds. This, of course, does not go down well with Lawrence's boss. To compound the problem she again speaks out passionately at the formal dinner where all of the Heads of State are attending. She is asked to leave and Lawrence is disgraced. He takes her to the airport devastated. He has lost his job and the woman he could have loved. Neither feel worthy of the other and they part. Lawrence stands at the airport screaming and crying.But wait - he calls her and tells her to turn on her television just as the results of the G8 summit are being announced..for which he and his fellow English people have fought valiantly, trying to keep alive the promises made in 2000.
