tt2476090,Cosmic Psychos: Blokes You Can Trust,Cosmic Psychos: Blokes You Can Trust,0,2013.0,95,Music,7.9,138.0,Matt Weston,"For 30 years, the Cosmic Psychos have blazed a trail of empty beer cans and busted ear drums around the globe with their quintessential Australian drawl and pounding punk rock songs. With the founding member Ross Knight finding inspiration from the Bulldozer he drove on the family farm in country Victoria, the band forged a unique sound and image that resonated with punk rock fans everywhere. Iconic label Sup Pop! released their second album when the band fell into the 'Seattle' scene of the late 80's amidst the likes of Pearl Jam, Mudhoney and The Melvins. Never quite finding the mainstream success of their grunge counterparts, the band managed to tour heavily in the USA and Europe thanks to a large and devoted fan base. The Cosmic Psychos were notorious for their ability to drink pubs dry, earning them a reputation that resonated around as a warning - Never drink with the 'Psychos. But it wasn't all shits and giggles. A heavy falling out with drummer and founding member Bill Walsh resulted in a line-up change and a bitter dedication on their new album with the song 'Kill Bill'. They've been ripped off by several record labels, and dealt with the tragedy of the passing of guitarist Robbie Watts in 2006. But the band continues through all its adversity to remain strong to this day with Dean Muller on drums and John 'Mad Macca' McKeering from the Onya's taking care of the guitar duties. COSMIC PSYCHOS : BLOKES YOU CAN TRUST follows the bands colorful history, as well as the enigmatic and entertaining founding member Ross Knight, to get behind the man who rides the bulldozer. Farmer, Father, Weightlifter, and frontman. His story alone, and told from his perspective is a unique portrait of an unlikely and revered rock and roll bloke.

When Budhia displays an uncommon talent for long-distance running, Biranchi nurtures his gift, heralding him as a folk hero for the impoverished masses, and maybe even for India itself. But after golden child Budhia breaks down during a world-record 65 kilometer run at the age of four, public opinion begins to turn on the guru and his disciple, and soon the two are swept up in a maelstrom of media controversy and political scandal. Following Budhia's roller-coaster journey over five years, Marathon Boy is a Dickensian tale of greed, corruption, and broken dreams set between the heart-racing world of marathon running, the poverty-stricken slums, and the political intrigue of a modernizing India. Nothing is what it seems in Budhia and Biranchi's story, and Atwal continually shifts viewer identification to tell both a shocking story of opportunism and exploitation, but also a touching portrait of an authentic bond between a parent and child.

tt0156794,Eternity and a Day,Mia aioniotita kai mia mera,0,1998.0,137,Drama,7.9,12903.0,Theodoros Angelopoulos,"Eternity and a Day (1998) is certainly the most accessible of Angelopoulos' work. The film opens with a shot of a majestic old house. We hear the beginning of the film's main musical theme, followed by a young boy in a voice-over calling young Alexander to join him to see an ancient city under the sea. Alexander tiptoes past his parents' bedroom, from where emanate a woman's giggles. Once outside the back door of the house, he runs on a short wooden walkway that ends at the beach, where he joins his two friends. He drops his short pants and they all three run into the sea and start swimming toward the open waters.Cut to Alexander (Bruno Ganz) as an older man, sitting in an armchair. He has just been awakened by his housekeeper, Urania (Helene Gerasimidou). This is the last day she says, Let me come with you to the hospital. Alexander, very philosophically, refuses and he thanks her for her three years of faithful service. She leaves the room, but promptly returns for an ultimate glance at Alexander, on the pretext of reminding him that his dog has eaten, before furtively leaving again. Alexander, now alone, finishes his cup of coffee. The camera moves to show the balcony, where the dog is lying down, and the sea panorama. Alexander turns on his record player which plays the film's theme for a moment. He turns it off, and looking through the window toward the harbor and then toward the adjacent building, he hears an echo of the same music coming from one of the apartments. Alexander says it happens every morning, and he wonders aloud who it might be and why.Alexander takes his dog for a walk along the harbor. As he walks, he reflects about how it all started with Anna (Isabelle Renauld), his dead wife, and how he had left so many of his projects unfinished. Alexander gets into his car and drives onto a main thoroughfare. At an intersection, street urchins take advantage of the red light to rush to the stopped cars and wash their windshields, hoping for tips. A young boy (Achileas Skevis) wearing an oversized yellow parka reaches for Alexander's windshield. The traffic resumes, police sirens are heard, and a group of policemen chase the young delinquents down the avenue. Alexander stops his car, opens the passenger door and shouts for the boy in the over-sized parka to get in. The policemen and the other boys run past his car as they watch: the boy has been saved from arrest. They turn into a side street where Alexander stops the car. He asks several questions in Greek to the boy, but the boy does not seem to understand. The boy, an Albanian refugee, gets out of the car, then turns toward Alexander, a stranger, with a big smile of gratitude before running off down the street (we never learn the boys name at any time during the film).When Alexander meets his daughter, Katerina (Iris Chatziantoniou), he tells her that he must go on a trip and needs her to keep the dog. She refuses, stating that her husband, Nikos (Vassilis Seimenis), does not want any animals in the house. Katerina asks her father about his third project, which was to complete the unfinished poem, Free Besieged, by Greece's National poet, Dionysios Solomos (1798-1857). Alexander replies that he hasn't finished it: Maybe I did not find the words? Alexander hands her a bundle of her mother's letters. One of them lacks an envelope, and he asks her to read it. It is dated 20 September, 1966, the day Katerina was born. She starts reading aloud, and soon we hear Anna, in a voice-over (Pemi Zouni), reading her own letter, full of nostalgia and regrets. Alexander's mind wanders back to that day some twenty years earlier. Anna's physical appearance is as it was on that day, but Alexander appears at his current age. Anna reproaches her husband for never being present, sharing his family's life, instead always traveling, physically or mentally, immersed in his books. Soon, Anna's mother (Alexandra Ladikou), father (Alekos Oudinotis), uncle (Nikos Kouros), and many other relatives arrive to see the new baby. They all run to the beach in front of the house, where Alexander's mother (Despina Bebedelli) is watching over newly born Katerina, asleep in her baby carriage.The reading ends. Alexander returns to the present, and is leaving when Nikos appears and tells him that they have sold Alexander's old house, which will be demolished, starting that very afternoon. Katerina tries to justify the sale, but Alexander does not want to listen to her excuses, and recalls aloud an event in her life, from the time when she was fifteen years old. Alexander leaves with his dog.As Alexander stops at a pharmacy to buy a painkiller, he looks across the street and sees the boy in the yellow parka and one of his friends being abducted by two men. He follows the men's car to an abandoned warehouse outside Thessaloniki. Soon, a bus full of middle aged people arrives. The people also enter the warehouse, and Alexander surreptitiously joins them. Inside, we see the boy and many other children, and we realize that these people are probably childless couples who came to buy some of the children. An older boy makes a break for it, and in the ensuing tumult, Alexander grabs the Albanian boy, pays the kidnappers, and walks out of the building with him.After driving a while, Alexander and the boy stop along the road at a bus stop. Alexander asks the boy if he has any relatives in Albania. The boy says he has a grandmother. Alexander negotiates with a bus driver to take the boy near the border. Alexander feels guilty in abandoning the boy, and he tries to explain to him that he, also, is going on a big journey today. As they walk together to the waiting bus, Alexander asks the boy what the words korphoula mou meant in a song the boy was singing. The boy gets on the bus, but as the bus barely starts rolling, it stops again, and he jumps out. Alexander decides to drive the boy to the border himself. On the way, he stops in a kafeneon and considers hiring a taxi to take the boy to the border. However, soldiers come in the kafeneon and the boys runs away. Alexander finds him terrified at a nearby street corner, and he finally decides to take him to the border himself.As they arrive at the border, in a landscape of mist and snow, the boy talks about the war he witnessed in his village and his escape to Greece with his friend, Selim. The border is a long, high fence to which many people are clinging, their limbs frozen. As Alexander and the boy walk toward the border, the boy admits that he lied, and that there is no grandmother on the other side. They run back to the car, pursued by an Albanian border guard. Later on, by the river, they stop for a sandwich from a food-truck. Alexander tells the boy about Solomos, who was born and raised on an Italian island. The camera, after a very long scan over the river, transitions to a man, the poet (Fabrizio Bentivoglio), dressed in 19th century garb. Although of Greek origin, he had been raised and educated in Italy. Inspired by the Greek rebellion against the Ottomans, he returned to his native island and wrote in Demotic Greek, the language of the common people. The legend tells that Solomos, not knowing this language well, used to buy Greek words from the peasants.Alexander and the boy drive into a village where there is a wedding procession in progress. It is led by an accordionist playing a Ponte piece of music (Ponte is a region in northern Turkey where a massacre of Greeks by the Turks took place in the 1920s, forcing the survivors to return to Greece). The bride follows, dressed in white, and she is in turn followed by the wedding party carrying some chairs. The groom appears from a doorway and, while dancing with his bride and followed by the wedding party, the couple goes to an open area surrounded by a high metal fence. Curious boys are hanging from that fence, in a manner reminiscent of the frozen people on the border fence. Alexander has come there with his dog. He meets his housekeeper, Urania, who reluctantly agrees to keep his dog for him.Alexander and the boy walk on the pier. Alexander, overcome and sick, sits on a bench. The boy says that he will go and get words for him. Alexander remembers a cruise he took with Anna and his family. Again, we hear Anna in voice-over, recalling her version of that day. Alexander's recollection continues with the same party as before, but they are now on the beach. He decides to climb to the top of a small cliff, and is reprimanded by Anna, who calls him a traitor. Alexander climbs anyway and explores the summit, where he finds a stone that has been engraved Christos, Vassillis, Alexander, Summer '39. He then goes to the end of the cliff and waves his handkerchief at a motorboat. A passing plane in the sky brings him back to reality on the pier, where a small group of people move by, carrying a young boy who had been drowning. Alexander meets his doctor, who was among the passersby, and says that he will enter the hospital tonight, as he had been told to do, when the pain gets to be too much.Cut to Alexander, searching inside a large building under construction for the Albanian boy, who has disappeared. He finds the boy, who is distraught over the death of his friend, Selim, the older boy who had brought him to Thessaloniki. Selim was run over by a bus, and his body now rests at the morgue. Alexander, the boy, and several of Selim's friends go to the morgue, and while Alexander distracts the guard, the boy sneaks into the chamber where Selim's body rests and steals his clothes. What follows is a ritual cremation of Selim's clothes. Many of his friends are hanging onto wooden fences, once more reminiscent of the scene at the border. A mournful clarinet music accompanies the ritual.Alexander goes to the hospital to see his mother: I came to say goodbye. But his mother does not hear him, as she is obviously affected by an advanced neurological disease and is only present in a physical sense. Alexander's previous dream of the family picnic on the beach continues. Soon, the sky opens up on the revelers and they all take cover, except for Alexander, who is looking for Anna, who has disappeared. He finds her alone by the sea. Back to reality, Alexander's mother collapses in his arms and he puts her back to bed. What follows is a touching soliloquy on the unfairness of life and Alexander's regrets.Alexander is walking alone in the night when the Albanian boy joins him and says that he is leaving tonight on a boat, heading for some unnamed destination. Stay with me, pleads Alexander, the boat does not leave for two more hours. They board a bus. Three men on bicycles, clad in yellow oilskins, drive by. They are alone until the next stop, Disembodied, where there is a street demonstration in progress, and a man with a red flag, obviously a participant, gets on board at the same time as a young couple who are arguing. The three bicyclists in yellow oilskins are riding alongside the bus. At the next stop, the couple leaves, and three musicians board the bus and begin to play. They get off the bus at the next stop, Conservatory, where the poet, Solomos, gets on. He sits across from Alexander and the boy, and recites his unfinished poem, Easter Sunday. When Solomos gets to the unfinished last line of his poem, Sweet is the life...and,... he repeats these first few words, unable to complete the line. As he leaves the bus, Alexander asks, Tomorrow, how long does it last?Alexander and the boy get off the bus, as the three yellow-clad men ride pass them by again. Alexander drives the Albanian boy to the dock, where the boy joins his many friends into a tractor-trailer which motors off and disappears into the departing boat.Alexander drives away in his car. He stops in the middle of the avenue, at a red light. The light changes, but Alexander's car does not move. The camera shows him immobile, lifeless at the wheel. The traffic goes around him, leaving Alexander's car standing alone in the middle of the avenue. The light turns red again. Suddenly, the car accelerates through the light, at great speed, down the avenue. The next scene shows Alexander as he enters his old, empty house by the sea. In a voice-over, Anna reads the letter she is writing to Alexander, about her special day, Katerina's birth day. Alexander walks through the house, to the back and to the beach, where his family is standing by the shore, singing. Anna approaches him, and they dance. Soon the whole group dances, then fades away, leaving the couple alone. Alexander makes future plans, and says to Anna, One day, I had asked you, how long does tomorrow last? Anna answers, An eternity and a day. She leaves, and Alexander is left alone, facing the sea, speaking Greek words aloud: korphoula mou (my little flower), xenitis (exile), and argathini (very late in the night)."

The Isleno Trappers had been squatting on marshland for many years, trapping muskrat and mink, and when fur prices shot up, Perez made a shrewd land deal that enabled him to jack up the rent on the land. When the Trappers balked, Perez tried to push them off the land right before trapping season. He brought in mercenaries from Texas to enforce his eviction order, and violence erupted. One St. Bernard sheriff's deputy was killed in the gunfire, and Perez never set foot in St. Bernard Parish again."

A sniper patrol sets out to disperse a Taliban roadblock. On route to the road block, in a dried out river bed at the foot of the ridge, LCpl Stuart Hale detonates a land mine, losing his leg. Cpl Mark Wright is a mile away when he hears the explosion. He quickly forms a patrol and they run down the steep hill to help. They go to LCpl Hale's side knowing the potential danger they are in. They begin prodding the ground, clearing a path away from the casualty, to an area where a helicopter could land, then carry Hale on a stretcher to the landing site. Cpl Stuart Pearson turns back along the cleared path. As he bends down to pick up a water container, there is another explosion. Pearson is only four or five yards away but any efforts by the patrol to reach him would risk another explosion. Cpl Pearson applies a tourniquet and doses himself with morphine while they wait for the helicopter. It finally arrives, but as it gets closer they realise that it's a Chinook, not the winch craft that was requested. It lands more than fifty yards away across ground that is likely to be covered with mines. There's no question of carrying the casualties to the Chinook. No one moves. The helicopter lifts off empty - its downdraft sets off another mine, blasting shrapnel into the shoulder, chest and face of Mark Wright. Medic LCpl Paul Hartley moves forward to help. He throws his medical pack on the ground in front of him to detonate any mines in his path. He reaches Wright safely. As he moves to the casualty, Fusilier Andy Barlow moves back to give him room, treading on a mine that severs his lower leg. The blast also blows Hartley to the ground and wounds Pte Dave Prosser. The only way the wounded and the stranded can escape the minefield is if they are lifted out, but there doesn't appear to be a helicopter readily available. Despite wounds to his arm, neck and chest, Mark Wright continues to maintain command and keep up his men's spirits, reassuring them that rescue is on its way. Three hours later, two American Black Hawk helicopters arrive to lift the men out of harm's way. On the helicopter, Cpl Mark Wright dies, having successfully coordinated the rescue of his injured comrades. Corporal Wright was posthumously awarded the George Cross."

Nonetheless she has continued to meet with Merton in secret, though he is growing increasingly impatient for her to leave her aunt and marry him.Aunt Maude confronts Kate about her continuing association with Densher and threatens to withdraw her financial support from Kate and her father. Kate reluctantly breaks with Merton and refuses to meet with him anymore. A few months later, at a dinner party given by her aunt, Kate is introduced to the wealthy American orphan and heiress Milly Theale (Alison Elliott), who is on an extended trip through Europe with her travelling companion Susan Stringham (Elizabeth McGovern). The cynical Kate is captivated by Milly's beauty, vivaciousness and humor, and the two form a strong friendship. Kate and Merton reconcile and resume their secret meetings; one day they run into Milly and Kate introduces Merton as a friend. Soon after Milly invites Kate to accompany her and Susan to Venice.Before leaving town, Lord Mark secretly reveals to Kate that Milly is terminally ill and that although he desires Kate he has to marry Milly to avoid losing his estates. Aware that Milly is indifferent to Lord Mark but is smitten with Merton, Kate invites Merton to Venice and persuades him to show Milly affection in an effort to seduce her. Kate expects that the orphaned and lonely Milly will leave him her fortune after her death.During Kate's, Milly's, and Merton's excursions through Venice, Kate gradually becomes jealous of Milly's attraction to Merton, so much so that she lures him away one night to have sex. Milly confronts her the next morning, though Kate denies that Merton is her lover. She realizes that she must leave, without warning Merton, if her scheme is to succeed. On their own in Venice, Merton's affection for Milly grows ever stronger and the two form a strong bond, even as her condition worsens. One day Merton spots Lord Mark at a cafe; alarmed, he goes to visit Milly but is denied entry. Susan visits him and Merton realizes that Kate has revealed their secret to Lord Mark to sabotage the whole scheme, knowing that Mark would tell Milly as revenge for her jilting him. Nonetheless Milly agrees to see Merton and the two share an intimate moment where she forgives him and says that she still loves both him and Kate, despite their actions. A few days later, Milly dies and Merton and Susan attend her funeral.A few weeks later, Merton returns to London where on one rainy evening Kate comes to Merton's flat. She asks why he has not come to see her in the weeks he has been back and finds a letter from Milly's attorneys, informing Merton that Milly did indeed bequeath a sizable portion of her estate to him. Merton tells Kate that he will not take the money, and she must marry him without it if they are to be together. She agrees, and they make love. But afterwards, Kate asks him to tell her that he is not still in love with Milly, or his memory of her, and he cannot. Kate leaves him for good, knowing that her conniving has backfired. Merton returns to Venice, alone."

This film takes that principal but instead of deceiving, the story invites you to watch the main characters dream away. With True Dreams, Allen takes the term dream sequence to a whole new level: he lets his audience in on the joke, while they watch the two main characters run around unaware of the reality/fantasy of their surroundings. It's pretty clear from the start that Colby and Liz have both fallen asleep and are dreaming. But whose dream is it? And which city does this dream take place in, New York, or Baltimore? Within the context of these dreams, we also see flashbacks of how the couple met and ultimately broke up. These episodes, existing within Liz and Colby's dreams, also suggest that, all along, like Edgar Allan Poe's famous quote, their [lives are] nothing but a dream within a dream.

He is found by local villagers who nurse him back to health. Within the small village(Dongmakgol), time appears to stand still. They have no knowledge of modern technology, such as guns and grenades. All villagers are unaware to the conflict within Korea.Meanwhile, not far from the village, a platoon of North Korean and South Korean soldiers have an encounter, and the ensuing gunfight leaves most of the North Koreans dead. The surviving soldiers from the North manage to escape through a mountain passage. The North Korean soldiers, Rhee Soo-hwa (Jeong Jae-yeong), Chang Young-hee (Lim Ha-ryong), and Seo Taik-gi (Ryu Duk-hwan) are found by an odd girl Yeo-il (Kang Hye-jeong) who acts crazy. She leads them to the village, where to their astonishment, they find two South Korean soldiers Pyo Hyun-chul (Shin Ha-kyun) and Moon Sang-sang (Seo Jae-kyung). The South Korean soldiers who, have both deserted their units had also been lead to the village which is housing the injured U.S. Navy pilot, Smith by a different villager.The unexpected encounter causes an armed standoff that lasts for several days. The villagers have no idea what the stir is about, and wonder why the two sides are standing there pointing those sticks at each other. The confrontation ends only when a soldier holding a grenade is worn by fatigue and accidentally drops it. Another soldier heroically throws himself onto the grenade, but it does not explode. He discards the dud over his shoulder in contempt, and it rolls into the village storehouse and blows up the village's stockpile of corn for the winter. The remnants fall down from the sky surrealistically as popcorn.The two groups of Korean soldiers and Smith now have to face the fact that their quarrel condemned the village to starvation in the following winter. They help the villagers in the fields to make up for the damage they have caused, and even work together to kill one of the wild boars that trouble the village. Tensions between the two groups of Korean soldiers gradually lessen, though members of both sides are haunted by the memory of terrible things they have experienced during the war.While this is happening, Allied commanders, who have lost several other planes in the area, are preparing a rescue team to recover Smith, whom they mistakenly believe has been captured by enemy units and is being held at a hidden base. The plan: when the rescue team finds and recovers Smith, a bomber unit is to fly in and destroy the anti-aircraft guns they presume are sited in the village, which means that the innocent villagers are now in grave peril.The rescue team, led by their commander (David Joseph Anselmo), drops in by parachute at night, suffering heavy casualties from the rough terrain. They enter the village, and under the assumption it is a cover for an enemy base, begin roughing up toward the villagers. Despite the efforts of the villagers to conceal the Korean soldiers by disguising them as villagers, a firefight breaks out in which all the members of the rescue team but one are killed and Yeo-il is fatally wounded by a bullet. The only survivor of the rescue team, the Korean translator, is hit over the head by Smith and is captured by the villagers.Through the translator, the people in the village find out about the bombing plan. The North and South Korean soldiers realize there is no time for Smith to make it back to his base to stop the bombing. The only possible way to save the village, they decide, is to create a decoy enemy base using equipment from the rescue team parachute drop, so that the bombing unit will attack them instead of the village.Smith is sent back along with the surviving rescue party member so that he can tell the Americans that there is nothing in the village to bomb, in case they decide to send more bombers. Meanwhile, the decoy is successful, and the remaining North and South Korean soldiers die smiling while a barrage of bombs explode around them. The village is saved, but at the cost of the lives of the former enemies who had later become friends."

This path breaking film is the first to document Sam Houston's remarkable life, in which viewers will find surprising points of identification: the teen-aged runaway who fled his controlling family to live with the Indians, the rejected husband who learned too late that his wife did not love him, the alcoholic forced to choose between ruin and sobriety -very modern sounding challenges. Yet Sam Houston lived out a triumphant American story: the only person ever to govern two states, conquering general, two-term President of the Republic of Texas, U.S. House member, U.S. Senator, and at the end a southerner banished from power and hated for his devotion to the Union. No one who learns Sam Houston's story will ever see American history the same way again."

You are good with a gun and become an assassin. They give you a target. You are betrayed, and they find you. You are shot twelve times, survive and end up in the dreaded Pollsmoor Prison. Now, on the inside, you are fighting for survival.
Odd Number is a story of redemption set in South Africas Cape Flats, a low lying area south west of Cape Town, a human dumping ground for Apartheid eras forced removals of black and coloured people from 1948 to 1993. During this time, hundreds of labelled non-whites were forced from their homes into undeveloped, dusty pieces of land. With little or no education, and no existing infrastructure or local economy, these areas withered. For years the Cape Flats have been ravaged by gang violence, drugs and crime, as some of South Africa's poorest do what it takes to survive.
Rashaad is the man in the midst of it all, trying to make sense and dying to make the right decision."
tt1611004,Autograph,Autograph,0,2010.0,131,Drama,7.4,2370.0,Srijit Mukherji,"Shubhabrata (Indraneil Sengupta), an ambitious but inexperienced filmmaker aims for success with his first venture into fiction, a remake of Satyajit Ray's Nayak (1966), replacing situations in the storyline with more contemporary ones, like the train journey with one by an airplane, and extends the ending of the original in his script. He makes several attempts to approach established star actor Arun Chatterjee (Prasenjit Chatterjee) to essay the hero's role (played by Uttam Kumar in the original) but is continually spurned by Arun's associates Ashish (Pijush Ganguly) and Partha (Dwijen Banerjee).Over time, Arun receives a severe jolt to his ego caused by a public putdown from successful producer Manoj Sarkar (Biswajit Chakraborty) on a TV channel. He decides to take it upon himself as a challenge to unilaterally churn out a hit movie, gets to learn of Shubhabrata's script and summons him. Enthused by Shubhabrata's passion and determination, he decides to finance the movie himself, besides playing the lead, and arranging for its production, overruling Ashish and Partha's objections. The film appears to him the ideal platform to prove his ability to deliver a hit single-handedly.After scouring among a few actresses for the lead actress' role (played by Sharmila Tagore in the Ray original), Shubhabrata decides to cast his live-in girlfriend Srinandita (Nandana Sen), Srin in short, an actress involved in translated European theatre, who he'd always had in mind while delineating the character in his script. After initial reservations, Srinandita agrees.Manoj comes to learn of the launch of the film and apporaches Shubhabrata with an offer to help out in case Arun subsequently falls out with Shubhabrata for some reason and decides to shelve the film, but is dismissed.While shooting progresses, Shubhabrata encourages the growing bonding between Arun and Srin in the interest of authenticity in the film. At the same time, however, he himself grows both in confidence and arrogance towards his cast and crew.Now the narrative of the film's storyline begins playing out parallelly in real life where the friendship between Srin and Arun grows to the extent that she turns from his companion into confidante. In a climactic moment, after the last day's shooting is over, Arun invites himself into Srin and Shubhabrata's apartment in a drunken state while the latter is away and confesses to having used an aspiring actress on the casting couch. Srin consoles him saying that his feeling of guilt signifies repentance and holds the promise of redemption.Accidentally, the confession gets recorded on Srin's handycam who's been using it to rehearse for her next stage appearance as Antigone. When Shubhabrata, who has meanwhile been searching for novel ideas to publicize his film, learns of its existence upon his return, he sees a golden opportunity to use it as publicity material and decides to grab it with both hands. Srin is aghast at the suggestion and dissuades him, extracting a promise from him to refrain.However, Shubhabrata soon breaks his promise, steals the clip from Srin's possession unbeknown to her and passes it on to a TV news channel. When Srin learns of this, she leaves him for an uncertain career as drama teacher in a girls' school away from the city.The next day, the channel plays the clip repeatedly and when Arun switches on the TV, he chances upon the clip. He holds both Shubhabrata and Srin guilty of betrayal and when Srin calls him trying to explain and apologise, disconnects. Asish fails to convince him to take legal action against the channel and assault Shubhabrata.When he finally confronts Shubhabrata and learns of Srin's departure, he realises her innocence. However, he decides to cancel the film, and warns Shubhabrata of using his influence to finish his career, short of causing him physical harm.As a final denouement, Shubhabrata, though he is shown to have begun missing Srin, is seen fixing an appointment with Manoj. The outcome of their meeting is however left undepicted, resulting in a partially open ending."
